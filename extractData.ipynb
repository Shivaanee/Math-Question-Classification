For example, in our study of linear equations we found it quite natural to consider linear combinations of the rows of a matrix. It is likely that the reader has studied calculus and has dealt there with linear combinations of functions; certainly this is so if he has studied differential equations. Perhaps the reader has had some experience with vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and in particular, with linear combinations of such vectors.\\n\",\n",
