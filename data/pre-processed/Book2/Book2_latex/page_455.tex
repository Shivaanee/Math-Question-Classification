Gradient.The partial derivatives of \(f\) with respect to its \(n\) arguments can be collected into an \(n\) vector called the _gradient_ of \(f\) (at \(z\)):

\[\nabla f(z)=\left[\begin{array}{c}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}(z)\\ \vdots\\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}(z)\end{array}\right].\]

Taylor approximation.The (first-order) Taylor approximation of \(f\) at the point \(z\) is the function \(\hat{f}:\mathbf{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) defined as

\[\hat{f}(x)=f(z)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}(z)(x_{1}-z_{1})+\cdots+ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}(z)(x_{n}-z_{n})\]

for any \(x\). We interpret \(x_{i}-z_{i}\) as the deviation of \(x_{i}\) from \(z_{i}\), and the term \(\frac{\partial
