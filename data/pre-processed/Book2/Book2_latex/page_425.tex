* _Robot manipulator._ Figure 18.26 shows a two-link robot manipulator in a plane. The robot manipulator endpoint is at the position \[p=L_{1}\left[\begin{array}{c}\cos\theta_{1}\\ \sin\theta_{1}\end{array}\right]+L_{2}\left[\begin{array}{c}\cos(\theta_{1}+ \theta_{2})\\ \sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})\end{array}\right],\] where \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\) are the lengths of the first and second links, \(\theta_{1}\) is the first joint angle, and \(\theta_{2}\) is second joint angle. We will assume that \(L_{2}<L_{1}\), _i.e._, the second link is shorter than the first. We are given a desired endpoint position \(p^{\rm des}\), and seek joint angles \(\theta=(\theta_{1},\theta_{2})\) for which \(p=p^{\rm des}\). This problem can be solved analytically. We find \(\theta_{2}\) using the equation \[\|p^{\rm des}\|^{2} = (L_{1}+L_{2}\cos\theta_{2})^{2}+(L_{2}\sin\theta_{2})^{2}\] \[= L_{1}^{2}+L_{2}^{2}+2L_{1}L_{2}\cos\theta_{2}.\] When \(L_{1}-L_{2}<\|p^{\rm des}\
