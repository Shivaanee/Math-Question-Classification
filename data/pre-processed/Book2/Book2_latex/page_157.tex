In this chapter we consider vector-valued linear and affine functions, and systems of linear equations.

### 8.1 Linear and affine functions

Vector-valued functions of vectors.The notation \(f:\mathbf{R}^{n}\to\mathbf{R}^{m}\) means that \(f\) is a function that maps real \(n\)-vectors to real \(m\)-vectors. The value of the function \(f\), evaluated at an \(n\)-vector \(x\), is an \(m\)-vector \(f(x)=(f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x),\ldots,f_{m}(x))\). Each of the components \(f_{i}\) of \(f\) is itself a scalar-valued function of \(x\). As
