holds for some \(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{k}\). We will show that \(\beta_{1}=\cdots=\beta_{k}=0\).

We first note that any linear combination of \(q_{1},\ldots,q_{k-1}\) is orthogonal to any multiple of \(q_{k}\), since \(q_{1}^{T}q_{k}=\cdots=q_{k-1}^{T}q_{k}=0\) (by definition). But each of \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k-1}\) is a linear combination of \(q_{1},\ldots,q_{k-1}\), so we have \(q_{k}^{T}a_{1}=\cdots=q_{k}^{T}a_{k-1}=
