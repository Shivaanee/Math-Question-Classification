Linear combinations of linearly independent vectors.Suppose a vector \(x\) is a linear combination of \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\),

\[x=\beta_{1}a_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{k}a_{k}.\]

When the vectors \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\) are linearly independent, the coefficients that form \(x\) are _unique_: If we also have

\[x=\gamma_{1}a_{1}+\cdots+\gamma_{k}a_{k},\]

then \(\beta_{i}=\gamma_{i}\) for \(i=1,\ldots,k\). This tells us that, in principle at least, we can find the coefficients that form a vector \(x\) as a linear combination of linearly independent vectors.

To see this, we subtract the two equations above to get

\[0=(\beta_{1}-\gamma_{1})a_{1}+\cdots+(\beta_{k}-\gamma_{k})a_{k}.\]

Since \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}\) are linearly independent, we conclude that \(\beta_{i
