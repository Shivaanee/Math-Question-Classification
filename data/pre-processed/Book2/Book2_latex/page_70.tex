## 3 Norm and distance

Norm of sum via angles.For vectors \(x\) and \(y\) we have

\[\|x+y\|^{2}=\|x\|^{2}+2x^{T}y+\|y\|^{2}=\|x\|^{2}+2\|x\|\|y\|\cos\theta+\|y\|^{2},\] (3.6)

where \(\theta=\angle(x,y)\). (The first equality comes from (3.1).) From this we can make several observations.

* If \(x\) and \(y\) are aligned (\(\theta=0\)), we have \(\|x+y\|=\|x\|+\
