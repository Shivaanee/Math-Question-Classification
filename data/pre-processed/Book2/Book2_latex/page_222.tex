### 11.1 Matrix inverses

The matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is defined as

\[\mathbf{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\ 0&1\end{array}\right)\mathbf{A}\] (11.1)

where \(\mathbf{A}\) is the matrix of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). The matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is defined as

\[\mathbf{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\ 0&1\end{array}\right)\mathbf{A}\] (11.2)

where \(\mathbf{A}\) is the matrix of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\). The matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is defined as

\[\mathbf{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\ 0&1\end{array}\right)\mathbf{A}\] (11.3)

where \(\mathbf{A}\) is the matrix of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\
