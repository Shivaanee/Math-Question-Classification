points \((x_{i},y_{i})\) are numbered so that \(x_{1},\ldots,x_{M}\leq a\) and \(x_{M+1},\ldots,x_{N}>a\). The sum of squares of the prediction errors is

\[\sum_{i=1}^{M}(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}x_{i}+\theta_{3}x_{i}^{2}+\theta_{4}x_{i}^{ 3}-y_{i})^{2}+\sum_{i=M+1}^{N}(\theta_{5}+\theta_{6}x_{i}+\theta_{7}x_{i}^{2}+ \theta_
