Figure 4.6: 25 images of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set. Each image has size \(28\times 28\), and can be represented by a 784-vector.

Figure 4.7: Clustering objective \(J^{\text{clust}}\) after each iteration of the \(k\)-means algorithm, for three initial partitions, on digits of the MNIST set.
