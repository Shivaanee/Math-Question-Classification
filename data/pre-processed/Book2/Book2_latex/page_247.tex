Figure 12.5: A square area divided in a \(25\times 25\) grid. The circles show the positions of 10 lamps, the number in parentheses next to each circle is the height of the lamp. The top plot shows the illumination pattern with lamps set to power one. The bottom plot shows the illumination pattern for the lamp powers that minimize the sum square deviation with a desired uniform illumination of one.
