* The under-determined linear equations \(A^{T}y=(1,2)\) has (different) solutions \[B^{T}(1,2)=(1/3,2/3,38/9),\qquad C^{T}(1,2)=(0,1/2,-1).\] (Recall that \(B^{T}\) and \(C^{T}\) are both right inverses of \(A^{T}\).) We can find a solution of \(A^{T}y=b\) for any vector \(b\).

Left and right inverse of matrix product.Suppose \(A\) and \(D\) are compatible for the matrix product \(AD\) (_i.e._, the number of columns in \(A\) is equal to the number of rows in \(D\).) If \(A\) has a right inverse \(B\) and \(D\) has a
