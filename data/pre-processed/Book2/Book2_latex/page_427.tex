* Use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to fit an ellipse to the 10 points: \[(0.5,1.5),\quad(-0.3,0.6),\quad(1.0,1.8),\quad(-0.4,0.2),\quad(0.2,1.3)\] \[(0.7,0.1),\quad(2.3,0.8),\quad(1.4,0.5),\quad(0.0,0.2),\quad(2.4,1.7).\] To select a starting point, you can choose parameters \(\theta\) that describe a circle with radius one and center at the average of the data points, and initial values of \(t^{(i)}\) that minimize the objective function for those initial values of \(\theta\).
