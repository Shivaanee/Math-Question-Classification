Figure 19.7 shows solutions for

\[L=0.1,\qquad N=50,\qquad h=0.1,\qquad\gamma=10,\]

and different values of \(x_{\rm final}\). They are computed using the augmented Lagrangian algorithm. The algorithm is started at the same starting point for each example. The starting point for the input variables \(u_{k}\) is randomly chosen, the starting point for the states \(x_{k}\) is zero.

Figure 19.7: Solution trajectories of 19.12 for different end states \(x_{\rm final}\). The outline of the car shows the position \((p_{1}(kh),p_{2}(kh))\), orientation \(\theta(kh)\), and the steering angle \(\phi(kh)\) at time \(kh\).
