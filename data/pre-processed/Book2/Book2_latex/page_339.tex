Example.We illustrate these ideas with a small example with synthetic (simulated) data. We start with a signal, shown in figure 15.11, consisting of a constant plus four sinusoids:

\[s(t)=c+\sum_{k=1}^{4}\alpha_{k}\cos(\omega_{k}t+\phi_{k}),\]

with coefficients

\[c=1.54,\quad\alpha_{1}=0.66,\quad\alpha_{2}=-0.90,\quad\alpha_{3}=-0.66,\quad \alpha_{4}=0.89.\] (15.8)

(The other parameters are \(\omega_{1}=13.69\), \(\omega_{2}=3.55\), \(\omega_{3}=23.25\), \(\omega_{4}=6.03\),
