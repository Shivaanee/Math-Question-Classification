Figure 5.3: Gramâ€“Schmidt algorithm applied to two 2-vectors \(a_{1}\), \(a_{2}\). _Top._ The original vectors \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\). The gray circle shows the points with norm one. _Middle left._ The orthogonalization step in the first iteration yields \(\tilde{q}_{1}=a_{1}\). _Middle right._ The normalization step in the first iteration scales \(\tilde{q}_{1}\) to have norm one, which yields \(q_{1}\). _Bottom left._ The orthogonalization step in the second iteration subtracts a multiple of \(q_{1}\) to yield the vector \(\tilde{q}_{2}\), which is orthogonal to \(q_{1}\). _Bottom right._ The normalization step in the second iteration scales \(\tilde{q}_{2}\) to have norm one, which yields \(q_{2}\).
