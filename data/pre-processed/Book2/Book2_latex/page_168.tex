Finally, we require that for each sector, the total production level matches the demand plus the total amount required to support production. This leads to the balance equations,

\[x=Ax+d.\]

Suppose the demand vector \(d\) is given, and we wish to find the sector output levels that will support it. We can write this as a set of \(n\) equations in \(n\) unknowns,

\[(I-A)x=d.\]

This model of the sector inputs and outputs of an economy was developed by Wassily Leontief in the late 1940s, and is now known as Leontief input-output analysis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for this work in 1973.
