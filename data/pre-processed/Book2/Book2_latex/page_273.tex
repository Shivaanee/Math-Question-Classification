Example.To illustrate these ideas, we consider the example shown in figure 13.6. Using a training set of 100 points, we find least squares fits of polynomials of degrees \(0,1,\ldots,20\). (The polynomial fits of degrees 2, 6, 10, and 15 are shown in the figure.) We now obtain a new set of data for validation, also with 100 points. These test data are plotted along with the polynomial fits obtained from the training data in figure 13.10. This is a real check of our models, since these data points were not used to develop the models. Figure 13.11 shows the RMS training and test errors for polynomial fits of different degrees. We can see that the RMS training error decreases with every increase in degree. The RMS test error decreases until degree 6 and starts to increase for degrees larger than 6. This plot suggests that a polynomial fit of
