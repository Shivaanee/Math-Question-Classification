Linear combinations.If \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}\) are \(n\)-vectors, and \(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{m}\) are scalars, the \(n\)-vector

\[\beta_{1}a_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{m}a_{m}\]

is called a _linear combination_ of the vectors \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\). The scalars \(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{m}\) are called the _coefficients_ of the linear combination.

Linear combination of unit vectors.We can write any \(n\)-vector \(b\) as a linear combination of the standard unit vectors, as

\[b=b_{1}e_{1}+\cdots+b_{n}e_{n}.\] (1.1)

In this equation \(b_{i}\) is the \(i\)th entry of \(b\) (_i.e._, a scalar), and \(e_{i}\) is the \(i\)th unit vector. In the linear combination of \(e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}\) given in (1.1), the coefficients are the entries of the vector \(b\). A specific example is

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}-1\\ 3\\ 5\end{array}\right]=(-1)\left[\begin{array}{c}1\\ 0\\ 0\end{array}\right]+3\left[\begin{array}{c}0\\ 1\\ 0\end{array}\right]+5\left[\begin{array}{c}0\\ 0\\ 1\end{array}\right].\]

Special linear combinations.Some linear combinations of the vectors \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}\) have special names. For example, the linear combination with \(\beta_{1}=\cdots=\beta_{m}=1\), given by \(a_{1}+\cdots+a_{m}\), is the _sum_ of the vectors, and the linear combination with \(\beta_{1}=\cdots=\beta_{m}=1/m\), given by \((1/m)(a_{1}+\cdots+a_{m})\), is the _average_ of the vectors. When the coefficients sum to one, _i.e._, \(\beta_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{m}=1\), the linear combination is called an _affine combination_. When the coefficients in an affine combination are nonnegative, it is called a _convex combination_, a _mixture_, or a _weighted average_. The coefficients in an affine or convex combination are sometimes given as percentages, which add up to 100%.
