Figure 15.4: _Top._ Hourly ozone level at Azusa, California, during the first 14 days of July 2014 (California Environmental Protection Agency, Air Resources Board, www.arb.ca.gov). Measurements start at 12AM on July 1st, and end at 11PM on July 14. Note the large number of missing measurements. In particular, all 4AM measurements are missing. _Middle._ Smooth periodic least squares fit to logarithmically transformed measurements, using \(\lambda=1\). _Bottom._ Smooth periodic least squares fit using \(\lambda=100\).
