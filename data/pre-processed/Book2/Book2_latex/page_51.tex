the \(\beta_{2}\) is negative, since one imagines that adding a bedroom to a house would _increase_ its sale price, not decrease it. To understand why \(\beta_{2}\) might be negative, we note that it gives the change in predicted price when we add a bedroom, without adding any additional area to the house. If we remodel a house by adding a bedroom that _also_ adds more than around 127 square feet to the house area, the regression model (2.9) _does_ predict an increase in house sale price. The offset \(v=54.40\) is the predicted price for a house with no area and no bedrooms, which we might interpret as the model's prediction of the value of the lot. But this regression model is crude enough that these interpretations are dubious.
