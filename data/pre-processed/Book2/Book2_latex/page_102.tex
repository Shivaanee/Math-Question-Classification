**Basis.** A collection of \(n\) linearly independent \(n\)-vectors (_i.e._, a collection of linearly independent vectors of the maximum possible size) is called a _basis_. If the \(n\)-vectors \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\) are a basis, then any \(n\)-vector \(b\) can be written as a linear combination of them. To see this, consider the collection of \(n+1\)\(n\)-vectors \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n},b\). By the independence-dimension inequality, these vectors are linearly dependent, so there are \(\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{n+1}\), not all zero, that satisfy

\[\beta_{1}a_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{n}a_{n}+\beta_{n+1}b=0.\]

If \(\beta_{n+1}=0\), then we have

\[\beta_{1}a_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{n}a_{n}=0,\]

which, since \(a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\) are linearly independent, implies that \(\beta_{1}=\cdots=
