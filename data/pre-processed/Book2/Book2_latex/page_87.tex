### 4.3 The \(k\)-means algorithm

Figure 4.3: Three iterations of the \(k\)-means algorithm. The group representatives are shown as squares. In each row, the left-hand plot shows the result of partitioning the vectors in the 3 groups (step 1 of algorithm 4.1). The right-hand plot shows the updated representatives (step 2 of the algorithm).
