Figure 18.16: The loss functions \(\ell(u,y)\) for linear least squares classification (top), nonlinear least squares classification with the sign function (middle), and nonlinear least squares classification with the sigmoid function (bottom). The left column shows \(\ell(u,-1)\) and the right columns shows \(\ell(u,+1)\).
