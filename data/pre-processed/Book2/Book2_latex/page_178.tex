### 9.1 Introduction

Linear dynamical systems are the most important ones in the study of dynamical systems. The dynamical system is a _linear dynamical system_, which is a system of equations that are invariant under the dynamical system. The dynamical system is a _linear dynamical system_, which is a system of equations that are invariant under the dynamical system.
