Let

\[\begin{array}{l}\beta_{j}\,=\,|f(\alpha_{j},\,\alpha_{j})|^{-\gamma_{j}}\alpha_{ j},\qquad 1\leq j\leq r\\ \beta_{j}\,=\,\alpha_{j},\qquad j>r.\end{array}\]

Then \(\{\beta_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\beta_{n}\}\) is a basis with the stated properties.

Let \(p\) be the number of basis vectors \(\beta_{j}\) for which \(f(\beta_{j},\,\beta_{j})=1\); we must show that the number \(p\) is independent of the particular basis we have, satisfying the stated conditions. Let \(V^{+}\) be the subspace of
