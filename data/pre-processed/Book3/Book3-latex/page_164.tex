1. If \(K\) is a commutative ring with identity and \(A\) is the matrix over \(K\) given by \[A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}0&\bullet&b\\ -a&0&c\\ -b&-c&0\end{array}\right]\]

show that \(\det A=0\).

2. Prove that the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix \[\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1&a&a^{2}\\ 1&b&b^{2}\\ 1&c&c^{2}\end{array}\right]\] is \((b-a)(c-a)(c-b)\).

3. List explicitly the six permutations of degree 3, state which are odd and which are even, and use this to give the complete formula (5-15) for the determinant of a \(3\times 3\) matrix.

4. Let \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) be the permutations of degree 4 defined by \(\sigma 1=2\), \(\sigma 2=3\), \(\sigma 3=4\), \(\sigma 4=1\), \(\tau 1=3\), \(\tau 2=1\), \(\tau 3=2\), \(\tau 4=4\). 1. Is \(\sigma\) odd or even? Is \(\tau\) odd or even? 2. Find \(\sigma\tau\) and \(\tau\sigma\).
5. If \(A\) is an invertible \(n\times n\) matrix over a field, show that \(\det A\neq 0\).
6. Let \(A\) be a \(2\times 2\) matrix over a field. Prove that \(\det(I+A)=1+\det A\) if and only if trace \((A)=0\).
7. An \(n\times n\) matrix \(A\) is called **triangular** if \(A_{ij}=0\) whenever \(i>j\) or if \(A_{ij}=0\) whenever \(i<j\). Prove that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product \(A_{1}A_{22}\cdots A_{nn}\) of its diagonal entries.
8. Let \(A\) be a \(3\times 3\) matrix over the field of complex numbers. We form the matrix \(zI-A\) with polynomial entries, the \(i\), \(j\) entry of this matrix being the polynomial \(\delta_{ij}x-A_{ij}\). If \(f=\det(xI-A)\), show that \(f\) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. If we write \[f=(x-c_{i})(x-c_{2})(x-c_{3})\] with complex numbers \(c_{i}\), \(c_{2}\), and \(c_{3}\), prove that \[c_{1}+c_{2}+c_{3}=\mbox{trace }(A)\quad\mbox{and}\quad c_{1}c_{2}c_{3}=\det A.\]
9. Let \(n\) be a positive integer and \(F\) a field. If \(\sigma\) is a permutation of degree \(n\), prove that the function \[T(
