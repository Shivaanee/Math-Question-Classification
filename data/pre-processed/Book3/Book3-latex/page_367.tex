identity operator on \(W^{\prime}_{j}\). In this case it is evident that \(T_{j}\) is unitarily equivalent to \(T^{\prime}_{j}\). If \(p_{j}=(x-a_{j})^{2}+b_{j}^{2}\), as above, then using the lemma and Theorem 20, we again see that \(T_{j}\) is unitarily equivalent to \(T^{\prime}_{j}\). Thus for each \(j\) there are orthonormal bases \(\hbox{\goth G}_{j}\) and \(\hbox{\goth G}^{\prime}_{j}\) of \(W_{j}\) and \(W^{\prime}_{j}\), respectively, such that

\[[T_{j}]_{\hbox{\goth G}_{i}}=[T^{\prime}_{j}]_{\hbox{\goth G}_{i}^{\prime}}.\]

Now let \(U\) be the linear transformation of \(V\) into \(V^{\prime}\) that maps each \(\hbox{\goth G}_{j}\) onto \(\hbox{\goth G}^{\prime}_{j}\). Then \
