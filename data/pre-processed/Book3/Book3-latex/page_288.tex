\[y\,=\,\frac{1}{2}\,(-3\,\pm\,\sqrt{13})x.\]

**Example 10**: _Let \(V\) be \(C^{n\times n}\), the space of complex \(n\times n\) matrices, and let \(E^{pq}\) be the matrix whose only non-zero entry is a \(1\) in row \(p\) and column \(q\). Then the set of all such matrices \(E^{pq}\) is orthonormal with respect to the inner product given in Example 3. For_

\[(E^{pq}|E^{rs})\,=\,\mbox{tr}\,\,(E^{pq}E^{rs})\,=\,\delta_{qs}\,\mbox{tr}\,\,(E ^{pr})\,=\,\delta_{qs}\delta_{pr}.\]

**Example 11**: _Let \(V\) be the space of continuous complex-valued (or real-valued) functions on the interval \(0\leq x\leq 1\) with the inner product_

\[(f|g)\,=\,\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\overline{g(x)}\,\,dx.\]

_Suppose \(\,f_{n}(x)=\sqrt{2}\ \ \cos 2\pi nx\,\) and that \(\,g_{n}(x)=\sqrt{2}\ \ \sin 2\pi nx\). Then \(\,\langle 1,f_{1},\,g_{1},\,g_{2},\,\ldots\,\rangle\) is an infinite orthonormal set. In the complex case, we may also form the linear combinations_

\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(f_{n}+\,ig_{n}),\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,n\,=\,1,\,2,\,\ldots\,.\]

_In this way we get a new orthonormal set \(S\) which consists of all functions of the form_

\[h_{n}(x)\,=\,e^{2\pi ins},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,n\,=\,\pm 1,\,\,\pm 2,\,\,\ldots\,.\]

_The set \(S^{\prime}\) obtained from \(S\) by adjoining the constant function \(1\) is also orthonormal. We assume here that the reader is familiar with the calculation of the integrals in question._

The orthonormal sets given in the examples above are all linearly independent. We show now that this is necessarily the case.

**Theorem 2**: _An orthogonal set of non-zero vectors is linearly independent._

Let \(S\) be a finite or infinite orthogonal set of non-zero vectors in a given inner product space. Suppose \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\alpha_{m}\) are distinct vectors in \(S\) and that

\[\beta\,=\,c_{1}\alpha_{1}+\,c_{2}\alpha_{2}+\,\cdots\,+\,c_{m}\alpha_{m}.\]

_Then_

\[(\beta|\alpha_{k})\,=\,\mathop{(\Sigma}_{j}c_{j}\alpha_{j}|\alpha_{k})\]

\[=\,\mathop{\Sigma}_{j}c_{j}\langle\alpha_{j}|\alpha_{k}\rangle\]

\[=\,c_{k}\langle\alpha_{k}|\alpha_{k}\rangle.\]

_Since \((\alpha_{k}|\alpha_{k})\neq 0\), it follows that_

\[\beta\,=\,\frac{1}{2}\,(-3\,\pm\,\sqrt{13})x.\]
