is invertible with inverse, \[P^{-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}\cos\theta&\sin\theta\\ -\sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{array}\right].\] Thus for each \(\theta\) the set \(\mathcal{O}^{\prime}\) consisting of the vectors (\(\cos\theta\), \(\sin\theta\)), (\(-\sin\theta\), \(\cos\theta\)) is a basis for \(\boldsymbol{R}^{2}\); intuitively this basis may be described as the one obtained by rotating the standard basis through the angle \(\theta\). If \(\alpha\) is the vector \((x_{1},x_{2})\), then \[[\alpha]_{\mathcal{O}^{\prime}}=
