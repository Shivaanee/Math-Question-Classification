in \(W\) such that \(S_{2}=S_{1}\cup\ \{\beta_{2}\}\) is independent. If we continue in this way, then (in not more than dim \(V\) steps) we reach a set \(S_{m}=S_{0}\bigcup\ \{\beta_{1},\ .\ .\ .\ ,\beta_{m}\}\) which is a basis for \(W\).

**Corollary 1.**_If \(W\) is a proper subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space \(V\), then \(W\) is finite-dimensional and dim \(W<\) dim \(V\)._

Proof.: We may suppose \(W\) contains a vector \(\alpha\neq 0\). By Theorem 5 and its proof, there is a basis of \(W\) containing \(\alpha\) which contains no more than dim \(V\) elements. Hence \(W\) is finite-dimensional,
