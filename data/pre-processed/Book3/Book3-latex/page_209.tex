simple matrix interpretation, and perhaps we should mention it at this point. Suppose we choose an ordered basis for \(V\) such that \(\mathbb{G}^{\prime}=\langle\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{r}\rangle\) is an ordered basis for \(W\) (\(r=\dim W\)). Let \(A=[T]_{\mathbb{G}}\) so that

\[T\alpha_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{ij}\alpha_{i}.\]

Since \(W\) is invariant under \(T\), the vector \(T\alpha_{j}\) belongs to \(\overline{W}\) for \(j\leq r\). This means that

\[T\alpha_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^
