matrix \(A\) an element \(\det A\) in \(K\). If \(\det A\) is considered as a function of the rows of \(A\):

\[\det A\,=\,D(\alpha_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{n})\]

then \(D\) is an \(n\)-linear form on \(K^{n}\).

**Example 11**: _It is easy to obtain an algebraic expression for the general \(r\)-linear form on the module \(K^{n}\). If \(\alpha_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{r}\) are vectors in \(V\
