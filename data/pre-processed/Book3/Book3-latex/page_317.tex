Let us now consider briefly change of coordinates in an inner product space. Suppose \(V\) is a finite-dimensional inner product space and that \(\otimes=\{\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\}\) and \(\otimes^{\prime}=\{\alpha_{1}^{\prime},\ldots,\alpha_{n}^{\prime}\}\) are two ordered _orthonormal_ bases for \(V\). There is a unique (necessarily invertible) \(n\times n\) matrix \(P\) such that

\[[\alpha]_{\otimes^{\prime}}=P^{-1}[\alpha]_{\otimes}\]

for every \(\alpha\) in \(V\). If \(U\) is the unique linear operator on \(V\) defined by \(U\alpha_{j}=\alpha_{j}^{\prime}\), then \(P\) is the matrix of \(U\) in the ordered basis \(\otimes\):

\[\alpha_{k}^{\prime}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}P_{jk}\alpha_{j}.\]

Since \(\otimes\) and \(\otimes^{\prime}\)
