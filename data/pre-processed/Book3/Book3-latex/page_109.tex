\(\mathfrak{G}^{*}=\langle f_{1},\ldots,f_{n}\rangle\) is the dual basis, then \(f_{i}\) is precisely the function which assigns to each vector \(\alpha\) in \(V\) the \(i\)th coordinate of \(\alpha\) relative to the ordered basis \(\mathfrak{G}\). Thus we may also call the \(f_{i}\) the coordinate functions for \(\mathfrak{G}\). The formula (3-13), when combined with (3-14) tells us the following: If \(f\) is in \(V^{*}\), and we let \(f(\alpha_{i})=\alpha_{i}\), then when
