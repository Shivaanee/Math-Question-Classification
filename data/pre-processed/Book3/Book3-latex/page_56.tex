and these vectors form an independent set. For suppose

\[\Sigma\ x_{i}\alpha_{i}+\Sigma\ y_{j}\beta_{j}+\Sigma\ z_{r}\gamma_{r}=0.\]

Then

\[-\ \Sigma\ z_{r}\gamma_{r}=\Sigma\ x_{i}\alpha_{i}+\Sigma\ y_{j}\beta_{j}\]

which shows that \(\Sigma\ z_{r}\gamma_{r}\) belongs to \(W_{1}\). As \(\Sigma\ z_{r}\gamma_{r}\) also belongs to \(W_{2}\) it follows that

\[\Sigma\ z_{r}\gamma_{r}=
