We are interested here in commutative rings with identity. Such a ring can be described briefly as a set \(K\), together with two operations which satisfy all the axioms for a field given in Chapter 1, except possibly for axiom (8) and the condition \(1\neq 0\). Thus, a field is a commutative ring with non-zero identity such that to each non-zero \(x\) there corresponds an element \(x^{-1}\) with \(xx^{-1}=1\). The set of integers, with the usual operations, is a commutative ring with identity which is not a field. Another commutative ring with identity is the set of all polynomials over a field, together with the addition and multiplication which we have defined for polynomials.

If \(K\) is a commutative ring with identity, we define an \(m\times n\) matrix over \(K\) to be a function \(A\) from the set of pairs \((i,j)\) of integers, \(1\leq i\leq m\), \(1\leq j\leq n\), into \(K\). As usual we represent such
