11. Prove that a normal and nilpotent operator is the zero operator.
12. If \(T\) is a normal operator, prove that characteristic vectors for \(T\) which are associated with distinct characteristic values are orthogonal.
13. Let \(T\) be a normal operator on a finite-dimensional complex inner product space. Prove that there is a polynomial \(f\), with complex coefficients, such that \(T^{*}=f(T)\). (Represent \(T\) by a diagonal matrix, and see what \(f\) must be.)
14. If two normal operators commute, prove that their product is normal.
