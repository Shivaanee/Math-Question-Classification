Sec. 8.4

**8.**: Let \(V\) be the vector space of the polynomials over \(R\) of degree less than or equal to 3, with the inner product

\[(f|g)=\int_{\mbox{\scriptsize$\bullet$}}^{1}f(t)g(t)\ dt.\]

If \(t\) is a real number, find the polynomial \(g_{t}\) in \(V\) such that \((f|g_{t})=f(t)\) for all\(f\) in \(V\).

**9.**: Let \(V\) be the inner product space of Exercise 8, and let \(D\) be the differentiation operator on \(V\). Find \(D^{\bullet}\).

**10.**: Let \(V\) be the space of \(n\times n\) matrices over the complex numbers, with the inner
