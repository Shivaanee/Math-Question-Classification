**8.**: Let \(A\) be a symmetric \(n\times n\) matrix over \(R\), and let \(q\) be the quadratic form on \(R^{n}\) given by

\[q(x_{i},\ .\ .\ ,\ x_{n})\ =\ \sum\limits_{i,j}A_{i}x_{i}x_{j}.\]

Generalize the method used in Exercise 7 to show that there is an invertible linear operator \(U\) on \(R^{n}\) such that

\[(U^{\dagger}q)(x_{1},\ .\ .\ .\ ,\ x_{n})\ =\ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}x_{i}^{2}\]

where \(c_{i}\) is \(1,\ -1,\) or \(0,\ i=1,\ .\ .\ .\ ,\ n\).

**9.**: Let \(f\) be a symmetric bilinear form on \(R^{n}\). Use the result of Exercise 8 to prove the existence of ah ordered basis \(({\mathfrak{B}}\) such that \([f]_{{\mathfrak{B}}}\) is diagonal.

**10.**: Let \(V\) be the real vector space of all \(2\times 2\) (complex) Hermitian matrices, that is, \(2\times 2\) complex matrices \(A\) which satisfy \(A_{ij}=\overline{A_{ji}}\).

* Show that the equation \(q(A)=\det A\) defines a quadratic form \(\varphi\) on \(V\).
* Let \(W\) be the subspace of \(V\) of matrices of trace \(0\). Show that the bilinear form \(f\) determined by \(q\) is negative definite on the subspace \(W\).

**11.**: Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space and \(f\) a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on \(V\). Show that for each linear operator \(T\) on \(V\) there is a unique linear operator \(T^{\prime}\) on \(V\) such that \(f(T\alpha,\beta)=f(\alpha,\ T^{\prime}\beta)\) for all \(\alpha,\ \beta\) in \(V\). Also show that

\[\begin{array}{rcl}(T_{1}T_{2})^{\prime}&=&T_{1}^{\prime}T_{1}^{\prime}\\ (c_{1}T_{1}+c_{2}T_{2})^{\prime}&=&c_{1}T_{1}^{\prime}+c_{2}T_{2}^{
