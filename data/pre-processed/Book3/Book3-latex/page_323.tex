\[(t-c)f(t)=0,\qquad 0\leq t\leq 1\]

and so \(f(t)=0\) for \(t\neq c\). Since \(f\) is continuous, \(f=0\). Hence \(T\) has no characteristic values (vectors).

**Theorem 17**: _Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional inner product space, and let \(T\) be any linear operator on \(V\). Suppose \(W\) is a subspace of \(V\) which is invariant under \(T\). Then the orthogonal complement of \(W\) is invariant under \(T^{*}\)._

We recall that the fact that \(W\) is invariant under \(T\) does not mean that each vector in \(W\) is left fixed by \(T\); it means that if \(\alpha\) is in \(W\) then \(T\alpha\) is in \(W\). Let \(\beta\) be in \(W^{\perp}\). We must show that \(T^{*}\beta\) is in \(W^{\perp}\), that is, that \((\alpha|T^{*}\beta)=0\) for every \(\alpha\) in \(W\). If \(\alpha\) is in \(W\), then \(T\alpha\)
