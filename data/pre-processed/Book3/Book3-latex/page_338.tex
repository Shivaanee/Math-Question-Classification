dently \(f_{\star}\) is a positive form on \(V_{\star}\) and, in the basis \(\{\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{k}\}\) it is represented by the matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}A_{\mathbf{1}}&\cdots&A_{\mathbf{1}k}\\ \vdots&&\vdots\\ A_{\mathbf{1}k}&\cdots&A_{\mathbf{1}k}\end{bmatrix}.\]

As a consequence of Theorem 5, we noted that the positivity of a form implies that the determinant of any representing matrix is positive.

There are some comments we should make, in order to complete our discussion of the relation between positive forms and matrices. What is it that characterizes the matrices which represent positive forms? If \(f\) is a form on
