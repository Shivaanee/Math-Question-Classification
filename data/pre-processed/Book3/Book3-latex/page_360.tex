Now let \(f_{j}=p/p_{j}\). Then, since \(f_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,f_{k}\) are relatively prime, there exist polynomials \(g_{j}\) with coefficients in the scalar field such that

\[1\,=\,\sum_{j}f_{j}g_{j}.\]

We briefly indicate how such \(g_{j}\) may be constructed. If \(p_{j}=x-c_{j}\), then \(f_{j}(c_{j})\neq 0\), and for \(g_{j}\) we take the scalar polynomial \(1/f_{j}(c_{j})\). When every
