and a vector in \(W^{\prime}\). If \(\beta\) is in \(W^{\prime}\), it follows that \(E\beta=0\). Hence \(I-E\) maps \(V\) onto \(W^{\prime}\).

The projection \(E\) constructed in the proof may be characterized as follows: \(E\beta=\alpha\) if and only if \(\alpha\) is in \(W\) and \(\beta-\alpha\) belongs to \(W^{\prime}\). Thus \(E\) is independent of the basis of \(W\) that was used in its construction. Hence we may refer to \(E\) as the **projection of \(V\) on \(W\)** that is **determined by** the direct sum decomposition

\[V=W\bigoplus W^{\prime}.\]

Note that \(E\) is an orthogonal projection if and only if \(W^{\prime}=W^{\perp}\).

**Theorem 8**: _Let \(f\) be a form on a real or complex vector space \(V\) and \(A\) the matrix of \(f\) in the ordered basis \(\{\alpha_{i}\), ..., \(\alpha_{n}\}\) of \(V\). Suppose the principal minors of \(A\) are all different from \(0\). Then there is a unique upper-triangular matrix \(P\) with \(P_{kk}=1\)\((1\leq k\leq n)\) such that_

\[P^{*}AP\]

_is upper-triangular._

Since \(\Delta_{k}(A*)=\overline{\Delta_{k}(A)}\)\((1\leq k\leq n)\), the principal minors of \(A*\) are all different from \(0\). Hence, by the lemma used in the proof of Theorem 6, there exists an upper-triangular matrix \(P\) with \(P_{kk}=1\) such that \(A*P\) is lower-triangular. Therefore, \(P*A=(A*P)*\) is upper-triangular. Since the product of two upper-triangular matrices is again upper-triangular, it follows that \(P*AP\) is upper-triangular. This shows the existence but not the uniqueness of \(P\). However, there is another more geometric argument which may be used to prove both the existence and uniqueness of \(P\).

Let \(W_{k}\) be the subspace spanned by \(\alpha_{1}\), ..., \(\alpha_{k}\) and \(W^{\prime}_{k}\) the set of all \(\beta\) in \(V\) such that \(f(\alpha,\beta)=0\) for every \(\alpha\) in \(W_{k}\). Since \(\Delta_{k}(A)\neq 0\), the \(k\times k\) matrix \(M\) with entries

\[M_{ij}=f(\alpha_{j},\alpha_{i})=A_{ij}\]

(\(1\leq i,j\leq k\)) is invertible. By Theorem 7

\[V=W_{k}\bigoplus W^{\prime}_{k}.\]

Let \(E_{k}\) be the projection of \
