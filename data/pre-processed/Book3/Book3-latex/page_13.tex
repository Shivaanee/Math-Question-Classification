equations in (1-1) is called a **solution** of the system. If \(y_{1}=y_{2}=\cdots=y_{m}=0\), we say that the system is **homogeneous,** or that each of the equations is homogeneous.

Perhaps the most fundamental technique for finding the solutions of a system of linear equations is the technique of elimination. We can illustrate this technique on the homogeneous system

\[\begin{array}{rll}2x_{1}-&x_{2}+&x_{3}=&0\\ x_{1}+&3x_{2}+&4x_{3}=&0.\end{array}\]

If we add \((-2)\) times the second equation to the first equation, we obtain

\[-7x_{2}-7x_{3}=0\]

or, \(x_{2}=-x_{3}\). If we add 3 times the first equation to the second equation, we obtain

\[7x_{1}+7x_{3}=0\]

or, \(x_{1}=-x_{3}\). So we conclude that if \((x_{1},x_{2},x_{3
