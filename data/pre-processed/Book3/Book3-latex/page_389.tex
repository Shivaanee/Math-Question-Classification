If \(f\) is a non-degenerate bilinear form on the finite-dimensional space \(V\), then each ordered basis \(\otimes\) for \(V\) determines a group of matrices 'preserving' \(f\). The set of all matrices \([T]_{\otimes}\), where \(T\) is a linear operator preserving \(f\), will be a group under matrix multiplication. There is an alternative description of this group of matrices, as follows. Let \(A=[f]_{\otimes}\), so that if \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are vectors in \(V\) with respective coordinate matrices \(X\) and \(Y\) relative to \(\otimes\), we shall have

\[f(\alpha,\beta)=X^{t}AY.\]

Let \(T\) be any linear operator on \(V\) and \(M=[T]_{\otimes}\). Then
