and these equations may be written more generally in the form

\[f_{j}(x_{1},\,x_{2},\,x_{3})\,=\,\frac{((x_{1},x_{2},\,x_{3})|\alpha_{j})}{|| \alpha_{j}||^{2}}.\]

Finally, note that from \(\alpha_{1},\,\alpha_{2},\,\alpha_{3}\) we get the orthonormal basis

\[\begin{array}{cccc}\frac{1}{3}&(3,\,0,\,4),&\frac{1}{3}&(-4,\,0,\,3),&(0,\,1, \,0).\end{array}\]

**Example 13**: Let \(A\,=\,\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{bmatrix}\) where \(a,\,b,\,c,\) and \(d\) are complex numbers. Set \(\beta_{1}=(a,\,b)\), \(\beta_{2}=(c,\,d)\), and suppose that \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\). If we apply the orthogonalization process to \(\beta_{1},\,\beta_{2}\), using the standard inner product in \(C^{2}\), we obtain the following vectors:

\[\alpha_{1} = \,(a,\,b)\] \[\alpha_{2} = \,(c,\,d)\,-\,\frac{((c,\,d)|(a,\
