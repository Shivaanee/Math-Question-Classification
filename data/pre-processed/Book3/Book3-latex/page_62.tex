To complete the above analysis we shall also prove the following result.

**Theorem 8**: \(Suppose\)\(P\) _is an \(n\times n\) invertible matrix over \(F.\) Let \(V\) be an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over \(F,\) and let \(\otimes\) be an ordered basis of \(V.\) Then there is a unique ordered basis \(\otimes^{\prime}\) of \(V\) such that_

\begin{tabular}{l l} (i) & \([\alpha]_{\otimes}\) = \(P[\alpha]_{\otimes^{\prime}}\) \\ (ii) & \([\alpha]_{\otimes^{\prime}}\) = \(P^{-1}[\alpha]_{\otimes}\) \\ \end{tabular} _for every vector \(\alpha\) in \(V.\)_

Let \(\otimes\) consist of the vectors \(\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}.\) If \(\otimes^{\prime}=\{\alpha_{1}^{\prime},\ldots,\alpha_{n}^{\prime}\}\) is an ordered basis of \(V\) for which (i) is valid, it is clear that

\[\alpha_{j}^{\prime}=\sum\limits_{i\,=\,1}^{n}P_{\,ij}\alpha_{i}.\]

Thus we need only show that the vectors \(\alpha_{i}^{\prime},\) defined by these equations, form a basis. Let \(Q\,=\
