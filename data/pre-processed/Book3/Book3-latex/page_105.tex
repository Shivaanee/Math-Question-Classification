2. What is the matrix of \(T\) in the ordered basis \[\langle\alpha_{1},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4}\rangle\] where \(\alpha_{1}=(1,0,1)\), \(\alpha_{2}=(-1,2,1)\), and \(\alpha_{4}=(2,1,1)\)? 3. Prove that \(T\) is invertible and give a rule for \(T^{-1}\) like the one which defines \(T\). **8.** Let \(\theta\) be a real number. Prove that the following two matrices are similar over the field of complex numbers: \[\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\ \sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{bmatrix},\qquad\begin{bmatrix}e^{i\theta}&0\\ 0&e^{-i\theta}\end{bmatrix}\] (_Hint:_ Let \(T\) be the linear operator on \(C^{\natural}\) which is represented by the first matrix in the standard ordered basis. Then find vectors \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\) such that \(T\alpha_{1}=e^{i\theta}\alpha_{1}\), \(T\alpha_{3}=e^{-i\theta}\alpha_{2}\), and \(\{\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\}\) is a basis.) **9.** Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\) and let \(S\) and \(T\) be linear operators on \(V\). We ask: When do there exist ordered bases \(\otimes\) and \(\otimes^{\prime}\) for \(V\) such that \([S]_{\otimes}=[T]_{\otimes^{\prime}}\)? Prove that such bases exist if and only if there is an invertible linear operator \(U\) on \(V\) such that \(T=USU^{-1}\). (_Outline of proof:_ If \([S]_{\otimes}=[T]_{\otimes^{\prime}}\), let \(U\) be the operator which carries \(\otimes\) onto \(\otimes^{\prime}\) and show that \(S=UTU^{-1}\). Conversely, if \(T=USU^{-1}\) for some invertible \(U\), let \(\otimes\) be any ordered basis for \(V\) and let \(\otimes^{\prime}\) be its image under \(U\). Then show that \([S]_{\otimes}=[T]_{\otimes^{\prime}}\).) **10.** We have seen that the linear operator \(T\) on \(R^{2}\) defined by \(T(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1},0)\) is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix \[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}.\] This operator satisfies \(T^{2}=T\). Prove that if \(S\) is a linear operator on \(R^{2}\) such that \(S^{2}=S\), then \(S=0\), or \(S=I\), or there is an ordered basis \(\otimes\) for \(R^{2}\) such that \([S]_{\otimes}=A\) (above). **11.** Let \(W\) be the space of all \(n\times 1\) column matrices over a field \(F\). If \(A\) is an \(n\times n\) matrix over \(F\), then \(A\) defines a linear operator \(L_{A}\) on \(W\) through left multiplication: \(I_{A}(X)=AX\). Prove that every linear operator on \(W\) is left multiplication by some \(n\times n\) matrix, i.e., is \(L_{A}\) for some \(A\). Now suppose \(V\) is an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\), and let \(\otimes\) be an ordered basis for \(V\). For each \(\alpha\) in \(V\), define \(U\alpha=[\alpha]_{\otimes}\). Prove that \(U\) is an isomorphism of \(V\) onto \(W\). If \(T\) is a linear operator on \(V\), then \(UTU^{-1}\) is a linear operator on \(W\). Accordingly, \(UTU^{-1}\) is left multiplication by some \(n\times n\) matrix \(A\). What is \(A\)? Let \(V\) be an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\), and let \(\otimes=\langle\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\rangle\) be an ordered basis for \(V\). **12.** Let \(V\) be an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\), and let \(\otimes=\langle\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\rangle\) be an ordered basis for \(V\). **13.** According to Theorem 1, there is a unique linear operator \(T\) on \(V\) such that \[T\alpha_{i}=\alpha_{i+1},\qquad j=1,\ldots,n-1,\qquad T\alpha_{n}=0.\] What is the matrix \(A\) of \(T\) in the ordered basis \(\otimes\)? **14.** Prove that \(T^{\alpha}=0\) but \(T^{\alpha-1}\neq 0\). **15.** Let \(S\) be any linear operator on \(V\) such that \(S^{\alpha}=0\) but \(S^{\alpha-1}\neq 0\). Prove that there is an ordered basis \(\otimes^{\prime}\) for \(V\) such that the matrix of \(S\) in the ordered basis \(\otimes^{\prime}\) is the matrix \(A\) of part (a). **16.** Let \(S\) be an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\), and let \(\otimes=\langle\alpha_{1
