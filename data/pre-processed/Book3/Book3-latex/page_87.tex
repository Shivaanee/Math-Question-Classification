**Example 9**: _Let \(F\) be a field and \(V\) the vector space of all polynomial functions from \(F\) into \(F\). Let \(D\) be the differentiation operator defined in Example 2, and let \(T\) be the linear operator 'multiplication by \(x^{\prime}\):_

\[(Tf)(x)\,=\,xf(x).\]

_Then \(DT\neq TD\). In fact, the reader should find it easy to verify that \(DT\,=\,TD\), the identity operator._

_Even though the 'multiplication' we have on \(L(V,\,V)\) is not commutative, it is nicely related to the vector space operations of \(L(V,\,V)\)._

**Example 10**: _Let \(\mathcal{G}=\{\alpha_{1},\,\ldots,\,\alpha_{n}\}\) be an ordered basis for a vector space \(V\). Consider the linear operators \(E^{p,q}\) which arose in the proof of Theorem 5:_

\[E^{p,q}(\alpha_{i})\,=\,\delta_{iq}\alpha_{p}.\]

_These \(n^{2}\) linear operators form a basis for the space of linear operators on \(V\). What is \(E^{p,q}E^{r,s}\)? We have_

\[\begin{array}{rcl}(E^{p,q}E^{r,s})(\alpha_{i})&=&E^{p,q}(\delta_{is}\alpha_ {r})\\ &=&\delta_{is}E^{p,q}(\alpha_{r})\\ &=&\delta_{is}\delta_{rq}\alpha_{p}.\end{array}\]
