All the solutions to the system of equations \(RX=0\) are obtained by assigning any values whatsoever to \(u_{1}\), ..., \(u_{n-r}\) and then computing the corresponding values of \(x_{k_{1}}\), ..., \(x_{k}\), from (1-3). For example, if \(R\) is the matrix displayed in Example 8, then \(r=2\), \(k_{1}=2\), \(k_{2}=4\), and the two non-trivial equations in the system \(RX=0\) are

\[\begin{array}{rll}x_{2}-3x_{3}&+\frac{1}{2}x_{5}=0&\mbox{or}&x_{2}=\,3x_{3}- \frac{1}{2}x_{5}\\ x_{4}+2x_{5}=0&\mbox{or}&x_{4}=\,-2x_{5}.\end{array}\]

So we may assign any values to \(x_{1}\), \(x_{3}\), and \(x_{5}\), say \(x_{1}=a\), \(x_{3}=b\), \(x_{5}=c\), and obtain the solution (\(
