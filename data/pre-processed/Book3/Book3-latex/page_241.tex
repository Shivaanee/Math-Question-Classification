vector \(\beta\) in \(V\) is of the form \(\beta=\gamma+\gamma^{\prime}\) where \(\gamma\) is in \(W\) and \(\gamma^{\prime}\) is in \(W^{\prime}\). If \(f\) is any polynomial over the scalar field, then

\[f(T)\beta=f(T)\gamma+f(T)\gamma^{\prime}.\]

Since \(W\) and \(W^{\prime}\) are invariant under \(T\), the vector \(f(T)\gamma\) is in \(W\) and \(f(T)\gamma^{\prime}\) is in \(
