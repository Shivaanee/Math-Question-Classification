even linear combinations of operators in \(\mathfrak{F}\); however, we shall show that they may be obtained by forming certain products of polynomials in elements of \(\mathfrak{F}\).

In the study of any family of linear operators on an inner product space, it is usually profitable to consider the self-adjoint algebra generated by the family.

A **self-adjoint algebra of operators** on an inner product space \(\mathrm{V}\) is a linear subalgebra of \(\mathrm{L}(\mathrm{V},\,\mathrm{V})\) which contains the adjoint of each of its members.

An example of a self-adjoint algebra is \(L(V,\,V)\) itself. Since the intersection of any collection of self-adjoint algebras is again a self-adjoint algebra, the following terminology is meaningful.

If \(\mathfrak{F}\) is a family of linear operators on a finite-dimensional inner product space, the **self-adjoint algebra generated by \(\mathfrak{F}\)** is the smallest self-adjoint algebra which contains \(\mathfrak{F}\).

Let \(\mathfrak{F}\) be a commuting family of diagonalizable normal operators on a finite-dimensional inner product space \(\mathrm{V}\), and let \(\mathfrak{a}\) be the self-adjoint algebra generated by \(\mathfrak{F}\) and the identity operator. Let \(\{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}}\}\) be the resolution of the identity defined by \(\mathfrak{F}\). Then \(\mathfrak{a}\) is the set of all operators on \(\mathrm{V}\) of the form

\[\mathrm{T}=\sum\limits_{j\,=\,1}^{k}\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}\mathbb{P}_{\mathrm{ i}}\]

where \(\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}\), \(.\,.\,.\,,\,\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{k}}\) are arbitrary scalars.

Let \(\mathfrak{C}\) denote the set of all operators on \(V\) of the form (9-15). Then \(\mathfrak{C}\) contains the identity operator and the adjoint

\[T^{*}\,=\,\sum\limits_{j}\,\overline{\mathrm{c}}_{j}P_{j}\]

of each of its members. If \(T=\sum\limits_{j}\,c_{i}P_{j}\) and \(U=\sum\limits_{j}\,d_{i}P_{j}\), then for every scalar \(a\)

\[aT\,+\,U\,=\,\sum\limits_{j}\,(ac\,+\,d_{i})P_{j}\]

and

\[TU =\,\sum\limits_{i,j}\,c
