some ordered basis by the matrix \(A\), then \(T\) and \(A\) have the same minimal polynomial. That is because \(f(T)\) is represented in the basis by the matrix \(f(A)\), so that \(f(T)=0\) if and only if \(f(A)=0\).

From the last remark about operators and matrices it follows that similar matrices have the same minimal polynomial. That fact is also clear from the definitions because

\[f(P^{\!-\!1}AP)\,=\,P^{\!-\!1}f(A)P\]

for every polynomial \(f\).

There is another basic remark which we should make about minimal polynomials of matrices. Suppose that \(A\) is an \(n\times n
