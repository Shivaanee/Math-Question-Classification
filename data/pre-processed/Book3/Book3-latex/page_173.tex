14. Let \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) be commuting \(n\times n\) matrices over the field \(F\). Show that the determinant of the \(2n\times 2n\) matrix \[\begin{bmatrix}A&B\\ C&D\end{bmatrix}\] is det \((AD-BC)\).

### Modules

If \(K\) is a commutative ring with identity, a module over \(K\) is an algebraic system which behaves like a vector space, with \(K\) playing the role of the scalar field. To be precise, we say that \(V\) is a **module over \(K\)** (or a \(K\)**-module**) if

1. there is an addition \((\alpha,\beta)\to\alpha+\beta\) on \(V\), under which \(V\) is a commutative group;

2. there is a multiplication \((c,\alpha)\to c\alpha\) of elements \(\alpha\) in \(V\) and \(c\) in \(K\) such that
