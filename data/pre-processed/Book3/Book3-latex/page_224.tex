which shows that \(T\alpha\) is in the range of \(E_{j}\), i.e., that \(W_{j}\) is invariant under \(T\).

Assume now that each \(W_{i}\) is invariant under \(T\). We shall show that \(TE_{j}=E_{j}T\). Let \(\alpha\) be any vector in \(V\). Then

\[\begin{array}{rcl}\alpha&=&E_{i}\alpha\,+\,\cdots\,+\,E_{k}\alpha\\ T\alpha&=&TE_{i}\alpha\,+\,\cdots\,+\,TE_{k}\alpha.\end{array}\]

Since \(E_{i}\alpha\) is in \(W_{i}\), which is invariant under \(T\), we must have \(T(E_{i}\alpha)=E_{i}\theta_{i}\) for some vector \(\theta_{i}\). Then

\[\begin{array}{rcl}E_{j}TE_{i}\alpha&=&E_{j}E_{i}\beta_{i}\\ &&=&\begin{cases}0,\quad\mbox{if}\quad i\neq j\\ E_{j}\beta_{j},\quad\mbox{if}\quad i=j.\end{cases}\end{array}\]

Thus

\[\begin{array}{rcl}E_{j}T\alpha&=&E_{j}TE_{i}\alpha\,+\,\cdots\,+\,E_{j}TE_{k} \alpha\\ &=&E_{j}\beta_{j}\\ &=&TE_{j}\alpha.\end{array}\]

This holds for each \(\alpha\) in \(V\), sc \(E_{j}T\,=\,TE_{j}\).

We shall now describe a diagonalizable operator \(T\) in the language of invariant direct sum decompositions (projections which commute with \(T\)). This will be a great help to us in understanding some deeper decomposition theorems later. The reader may feel that the description which we are about to give is rather complicated, in comparison to the matrix formulation or to the simple statement that the characteristic vectors of \(T\) span the underlying space. But, he should bear in mind that this is our first glimpse at a very effective method, by means of which various problems concerned with subspaces, bases, matrices, and the like can be reduced to algebraic calculations with linear operators. With a little experience, the efficiency and elegance of this method of reasoning should become apparent.

**Theorem 11**: _Let \(T\) be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional space \(V\)._

_If \(T\) is diagonalizable and if \(c_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(c_{k}\) are the distinct characteristic values of \(T\), then there exist linear operators \(E_{i}\), \(\ldots\), \(E_{k}\) on \(V\) such that_
