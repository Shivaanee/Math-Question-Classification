\[f(\alpha)\,=\,f(P\alpha)\]

for all \(\alpha\) in \(V\). Suppose \(f\neq 0\). Then \(f\) is of rank \(1\) and \(\dim\,(W^{\perp})=1\). If \(\gamma\) is any non-zero vector in \(W^{\perp}\), it follows that

\[P\alpha\,=\,\frac{(\alpha|\gamma)}{||\gamma||^{2}}\,\gamma\]

for all \(\alpha\) in \(V\). Thus

\[f(\alpha)\,=\,(\alpha|\gamma)\,\cdot\,\
