\(V\). The matrix \(P\) (above) is precisely the matrix of the operator \(U\) in the ordered basis \(\otimes\). For, \(P\) is defined by

\[\alpha^{\prime}_{j}=\sum_{i\,=\,1}^{n}P_{i\,j}\alpha_{i}\]

and since \(U\alpha_{j}=\,\alpha^{\prime}_{j}\), this equation can be written

\[U\alpha_{j}=\sum_{i\,=\,1}^{n}P_{i\,j}\alpha_{i}.\]

So \(P=[U]_{\otimes}\), by definition.

**Theorem 14**: _Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\), and let_

\[\otimes\,=\,\{\alpha_
