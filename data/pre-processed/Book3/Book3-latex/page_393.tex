11. Let \(F\) be a subfield of \(C\), \(V\) a finite-dimensional vector space over \(F\), and \(f\) a non-singular bilinear form on \(V\). If \(T\) is a linear operator on \(V\) preserving \(f\), prove that \(\det T=\pm 1\).
12. Let \(F\) be a subfield of \(C\), \(V\) the space of \(n\times 1\) matrices over \(F\), \(A\) a n invertible \(n\times n\) matrix over \(F\), and \(f\) the bilinear form on \(V\) given by \(f(X,\,Y)=X^{t}A\,Y\). If \(M\) is an \(n\times n\) matrix over \(F\), show that \(M\) preserves \(f\
