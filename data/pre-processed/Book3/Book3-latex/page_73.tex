1. If \[PY=\left[\begin{array}{c}y_{1}\\ y_{1}\to y_{2}\\ y_{b}\\ -y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}\\ -3y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{4}-y_{b}\end{array}\right]\] for all \(Y\), then \[P=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}1&0&0&0&0\\ 1&-1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&1\\ -1&1&1&0&0\\ -3&1&0&1&-1\end{array}\right]\] hence \(PA\) is the row-reduced echelon matrix \[R\,=\,\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}1&2&0&3&0\\ 0&0&1&4&0\\ 0&0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&0\end{array}\right]\!.\] It should be stressed that the matrix \(P\) is not unique. There are, in fact, many invertible matrices \(P\) (which arise from different choices for the operations used to reduce \(A^{\prime}\)) such that \(PA\,=\,R\). 2. As a basis for \(W\) we may take the non-zero rows \[\begin{array}{ccccc}\rho_{1}&=&(1&2&0&3&0)\\ \rho_{2}&=&(0&0&1&4&0)\\ \rho_{3}&=&(0&0&0&0&1)\end{array}\] of \(R\). 3. The row-space \(W\) consists of all vectors of the form \[\begin{array}{ccccc}\beta&=&c_{1}\rho_{1}+c_{2}\rho_{2}+c_{3}\rho_{3}\\ =&(c_{1},2c_{1},c_{2},3c_{1}+4c_{2},c_{3})\end{array}\] where \(c_{1}\), \(c_{2}\), \(c_{3}\) are arbitrary scalars. Thus \((b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},b_{4},b_{5})\) is in \(W\) if and only if \[(b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},b_{4},b_{5})\,=\,b_{1}\rho_{1}+b_{3}\rho_{2}+b_{5}\rho_{3}\] which is true if and only if \[\begin{array}{rl}b_{2}&=&2b_{1}\\ b_{4}&=&3b_{1}+4b_{3}.\end{array}\] These equations are instances of the general system (2-25), and using them we may tell at a glance whether a given vector lies in \(W\). Thus \((-5,\,-10,\,1,\,-11,\,20)\) is a linear combination of the rows of \(A\), but \((1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5)\) is not. 4. The coordinate matrix of the vector \((b_{1},2b_{1},b_{3},3b_{1}+4b_{1},b_{5})\) in the basis \(\{\rho_{1},\,\rho_{2},\,\rho_{3}\}\) is evidently 5. The coordinate matrix of the vector \((b_{1},2b_{1},b_{3},3b_{1}+4b_{1},b_{5})\) in the basis \(\{\rho_{1},\,\rho_{2},\,\rho_{3}\}\) is evidently 6. The coordinate matrix of the vector \((b_{1},2b_{1},b_{3},3b_{1}+4b_{1},b_{5})\) in the basis \(\{\rho_{1},\,\rho_{2},\,\rho_{3}\}\) is evidently 7. The coordinate matrix of the vector \((b_{1},2b_{1},b_{3},3b_{1}+4b_{1},b_{5})\) in the basis \(\{\rho_{1},\,\rho_{2},\,\rho_{3}\}\) is evidently 8. The coordinate matrix of the vector \((b_{1},2b_{1},b_{3},3b_{1}+4b_{1},b_{5})\) in the basis \(\{\rho_{1},\,\rho_{2},\,\rho_{3}\}\) is evidently 9. The coordinate matrix of the vector \((b_{1},2b_{1},b_{3},3b
