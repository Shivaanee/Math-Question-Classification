\[||\beta-\gamma||^{z} =||E\beta||^{z}+||\beta-E\beta-\gamma||^{z}\] \[\geq||\beta-(\beta-E\beta)||^{z}\]

with strict inequality when \(\gamma\neq\beta-E\beta\). Therefore, \(\beta-E\beta\) is the best approximation to \(\beta\) by vectors in \(W^{\bot}\).

**Example 14**: _Give \(R^{3}\) the standard inner product. Then the orthogonal projection of \((-10,2,8)\) on the subspace \(W\) that is spanned by \((3,\,12,\,-1)\) is the vector_

\[\alpha =\frac{((-10,2,8)|(3,\,12,\,-1))}{9+144+1}\,(3,\,12,\,-1)\] \[=\frac{-14}{154}\,(3,\,12,\,-1).\]

_The orthogonal projection of \(R^{3}\) on \(W\) is the linear transformation \(E\) defined by_
