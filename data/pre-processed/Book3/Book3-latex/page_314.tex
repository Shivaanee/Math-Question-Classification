_The \(\theta\) is a real number, and \(a,b\) are complex numbers such that \(|a|^{2}+|b|^{2}=1\)._

As noted earlier, the unitary operators on an inner product space form a group. From this and Theorem 13 it follows that the set \(U(n)\) of all \(n\)\(\mathsf{X}\)\(n\) unitary matrices is also a group. Thus the inverse of a unitary matrix and the product of two unitary matrices are again unitary. Of course this is easy to see directly. An \(n\)\(\mathsf{X}\)\(n\) matrix \(A\) with complex entries is unitary if and only if \(A^{-1}=A^{\star}\). Thus, if \(A\) is unitary, we have \((A^{-1}
