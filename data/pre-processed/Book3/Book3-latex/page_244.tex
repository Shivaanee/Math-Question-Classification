where \(\boldsymbol{\gamma_{0}}\) is in \(W_{0}\) and \(h_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(h_{k-1}\) are polynomials. Let

\[\alpha_{k}\,=\,\beta_{k}\,-\,\boldsymbol{\gamma_{0}}\,-\,\sum_{1\leq i<k}\,h_{i} \beta_{i}.\] (7-10)

Since \(\beta_{k}\,-\,\alpha_{k}\) is in \(W_{k-1}\),

\[s(\alpha_{k};\,W_{k-1})\,=\,s(\
