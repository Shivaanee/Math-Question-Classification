Proof.: According to Theorem 7, condition (ii) is equivalent to the fact that \(A\) is row-equivalent to the identity matrix. By Theorem 12, (i) and (ii) are therefore equivalent. If \(A\) is invertible, the solution of _A_\(X\) _=_ Y_ is \(X=A^{-1}Y\). Conversely, suppose _AX_ = \(Y\) has a solution for each given \(Y\). Let \(R\) be a row-reduced echelon matrix which is row
