For each of the following polynomials \(f\) over \(F\), compute \(f(A)\).

(a) \(f=x^{2}-x+2\);

(b) \(f=x^{3}-1\);

(c) \(f=x^{3}-5x+7\).

**2.** Let \(T\) be the linear operator on \(R^{3}\) defined by

\[T(x_{1},\,x_{2},\,x_{3})=\ (x_{1},\,x_{3},\,-2x_{2}-x_{3}).\]

Let \(f\) be the polynomial over \(R\) defined by \(f=-x^{3
