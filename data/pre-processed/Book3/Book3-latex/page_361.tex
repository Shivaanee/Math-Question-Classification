**Corollary**.: _Let \(T\) be a normal operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space \(V\) and \(W_{1},\ldots,\)\(W_{k}\) the primary components of \(V\) under \(T.\) Suppose \(W\) is a subspace of \(V\) which is invariant under \(T.\) Then_

\[W=\sum_{i}W\cap W_{j}.\]

_Proof_. Clearly \(W\) contains \(\sum\limits_{j}W\cap W_{j}.\) On the other hand, \(W,\) being invariant under \(T,\) is invariant under every polynomial in \(T.\) In particular, \(W\) is invariant under the orthogonal projection \(E_{j}\) of \(V\) on \(W_{j}.\) If \(\alpha\) is in \(W,\) it follows that \(E_{j}\alpha\) is in \(W\cap W_{j},\)
