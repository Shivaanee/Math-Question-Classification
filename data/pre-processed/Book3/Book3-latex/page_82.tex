explicit calculations concerning systems of linear equations. There is a more conceptual proof which does not rely on such calculations. We shall give such a proof in Section 3.7.

### Exercises

1. Which of the following functions \(T\) from \(R^{2}\) into \(R^{2}\) are linear transformations? 1. \(T(x_{1},x_{2})=(1+x_{1},x_{2})\); 2. \(T(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{2},x_{1})\); 3. \(T(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1}^{2},x_{2})\); 4. \(T(x_{1},x_{2})=(\sin x_{1},x_{2})\); 5. \(T(x_{1},x_{
