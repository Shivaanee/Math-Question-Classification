If \(k=1\), this is just the statement that \(W_{0}\) is \(T\)-admissible. In order to prove the assertion for \(k>1\), apply the division algorithm:

\[g_{i}=fh_{i}+r_{i},\qquad r_{i}=0\quad\text{or}\quad\deg r_{i}<\deg f.\]

We wish to show that \(r_{i}=0\) for each \(i\). Let

\[\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\beta-\sum\limits_{1}^{k-1}h_{i}\beta_{i}.\]

Since \(\boldsymbol{\gamma}-\beta\) is in \(W_{k-1}\),

\[s(\boldsymbol{\gamma};W_{k-1})=s(\beta;W_{k-1})=f.\]

Furthermore

\[f\boldsymbol{\gamma}=\beta
