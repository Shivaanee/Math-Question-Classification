\(W_{j}\) (\(1\leq j\leq k\)) of \(V\) under \(T\). Then \(E_{j}\) is a polynomial in \(T\) and hence commutes with \(U\). Thus

\[E_{j}UE_{j}=UE_{j}^{2}=UE_{j}.\]

Thus \(U(W_{j})\) is a subset of \(W_{j}\). Let \(T_{j}\) and \(U_{j}\) denote the restrictions of \(T\) and \(U\) to \(W_{j}\). Suppose \(I_{j}\) is the identity operator on \(W_{j}\). Then \(U_{j}\) commutes with \(T_{j}\), and if \(T_{j}=c_{j}I_{j}\), it is clear that \(U_{j}\)
