properties of inner products. Then we turn to the task of discussing length and orthogonality.

**Definition**.: _Let \(F\) be the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers, and \(V\) a vector space over \(F\). An_ **inner product** _on \(V\) is a function which assigns to each ordered pair of vectors \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) in \(V\) a scalar \((\alpha|\beta)\) in \(F\) in such a way that for all \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\) in \(V\) and all scalars \(c\)_

1. \((\alpha+\beta|\gamma)=(\alpha|\gamma)+(\beta|\gamma)\)_;_
2. \((c\alpha|\beta)=c(\alpha|\beta)\)_;_
3. \((\beta|\alpha)=(\overline{\alpha|\beta})\)_, the bar denoting complex conjugation;_
4. \((\alpha|\alpha)>0\) _if_ \(\alpha\neq 0\)_._

It should be observed that conditions (a), (b), and (c) imply that

1. \((\alpha|c\beta+\gamma)=\bar{c}(\alpha|\beta)+(\alpha|\gamma)\).

One other point should be made. When \(F\) is the field \(R\) of real numbers, the complex conjugates appearing in (c) and (e) are superfluous; however, in the complex case they are necessary for the consistency of the conditions. Without these complex conjugates, we would have the contradiction:

\[(\alpha|\alpha)>0\quad\mbox{and}\quad(i\alpha|i\alpha)=-1(\alpha|\alpha)>0.\]

In the examples that follow and throughout the chapter, \(F\) is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers.

**Example 1**.: On \(F^{n}\) there is an inner product which we call the **standard inner product**.: It is defined on \(\alpha=(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\) and \(\beta=(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n})\) by

(8-1) \[(\alpha|\beta)=\sum_{j}x_{j}\vec{y}_{j}.\]

When \(F=R\), this may also be written

\[(\alpha|\beta)=\sum_{j}x_{j}\vec{y}_{j}.\]

In the real case, the standard inner product is often called the dot or scalar product and denoted by \(\alpha\cdot\beta\).

**Example 2**.: For \(\alpha=(x_{1},x_{2})\) and \(\beta=(y_{1},y_{2})\) in \(R^{2}\), let

\[(\alpha|\beta)=x_{1}y_{1}-x_{2}y_{1}-x_{1}y_{2}+4x_{2}y_{2}.\]

Since \((\alpha|\alpha)=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+3x_{2}^{2}\), it follows that \((\alpha|\alpha)>0\) if \(\alpha\neq
