### Functions

* A **function** consists of the following: 1. a set \(X\), called the domain of the function; 2. a set \(Y\), called the co-domain of the function; 3. a rule (or correspondence) \(f\), which associates with each element \(x\) of \(X\) a single element \(f(x)\) of \(Y\). If \((X,\,Y,f)\) is a function, we shall also say \(f\)**is a function from \(X\) into \(Y\). This is a bit sloppy, since it is not \(f\) which is the function; \(f\) is the rule of the function. However, this use of the same symbol for the function and its rule provides one with a much more tractable way of speaking about functions. Thus we shall say that \(f\) is a function from \(X\) into \(Y\), that \(X\) is the domain of \(f\), and that \(Y\) is the co-domain of \(f\)--all this meaning that \((X,\,Y,f)\) is a function as defined above. There are several other words which are commonly used in place of the word 'function.' Some of these are 'transformation,' 'operator,' and 'mapping.' These are used in contexts where they seem more suggestive in conveying the role played by a particular function. If \(f\) is a function from \(X\) into \(Y\), the **range** (or **image**) of \(f\) is the set of all \(f(x)\), \(x\) in \(X\). In other words, the range of \(f\) consists of all elements \(y\) in \(Y\) such that \(y=f(x)\) for some \(x\) in \(X\). If the range of \(f\) is all of \(Y\), we say that \(f\) is a **function from \(X\) onto \(Y\)**, or simply that \(f\) is **onto.** The range of \(f\) is often denoted \(f(X)\).

**Example 2**: (a) Let \(X\) be the set of real numbers, and let \(Y=X\). Let \(f\) be the function from \(X\) into \(Y\) defined by \(f(x)=x^{\mbox{\tiny{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{ \rm{\rm{\rm{ \rm{ \rm{ \rm{ \rm{ \rm{
