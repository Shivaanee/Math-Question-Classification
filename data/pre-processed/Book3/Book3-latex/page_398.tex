points \((x_{1},x_{2})\) with \(x_{2}=0\). If \(P\) is a point of \(X\), let \(f(P)\) be the point obtained by projecting \(P\) onto the \(x_{1}\)-axis, parallel to the \(x_{2}\)-axis. In other words, \(f((x_{1},x_{2}))=(x_{1},0)\). The range of \(f\) is all of \(Y\), and so \(f\) is onto.

Let \(X\) be the set of real numbers, and let \(Y\) be the set of positive real numbers. Define a function \(f\) from \(X\) into \(Y\) by \(f(x)=e^{x}\). Then \(f\) is a function from \(X\) onto \(Y\).

Let \(X\) be the set of positive real numbers and \(Y\) the set of all real numbers. Let \(f\) be the natural logarithm function, that is, the function defined by \(f(x)=\log x=
