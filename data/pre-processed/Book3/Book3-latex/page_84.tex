\[\begin{array}{ll}(cT)(d\alpha+\beta)&=&c[T(d\alpha+\beta)]\\ &=&c[d(T\alpha)+T\beta]\\ &=&d[c(T\alpha)]+c(T\beta)\\ &=&d[(cT)\alpha]+(cT)\beta\end{array}\]

which shows that \((cT)\) is a linear transformation.

To verify that the set of linear transformations of \(V\) into \(W\) (together with these operations) is a vector space, one must directly check each of the conditions on the vector addition and scalar multiplication. We leave the bulk of this to the reader, and content ourselves with this comment: The zero vector in this space will be the zero transformation, which sends every vector of \(V\) into the zero vector in \(W\); each of the properties of the two operations follows from the corresponding property of the operations in the space \(W\).

We should perhaps mention another way of looking at this theorem. If one defines sum and scalar multiple as we did above, then the set of _all_ functions from \(V\) into \(W\) becomes a vector space over the field \(F\). This has nothing to do with the fact that \(V\) is a vector space, only that \(V\) is a non-empty set. When \(V\) is a vector space we can define a linear transformation from \(V\) into \(W\), and Theorem 4 says that the linear transformations are a subspace of the space of all functions from \(V\) into \(W\).

We shall denote the space of linear transformations from \(V\) into \(W\) by \(L(V\), \(W)\). We remind the reader that \(L(V\), \(W)\) is defined only when \(V\) and \(W\) are vector spaces over the same field.

**Theorem 5**: _Let \(\mathrm{V}\) be an \(\mathrm{n}\)-dimensional vector space over the field \(\mathrm{F}\), and let \(\mathrm{W}\) be an \(\mathrm{m}\)-dimensional vector space over \(\mathrm{F}\). Then the space \(\mathrm{L(V,\,W)}\) is finite-dimensional and has dimension \(\mathrm{mn}\)._

Let

\[\boxplus=\{\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\}\quad\mathrm{and}\quad\boxplus^{ \prime}=\{\beta_{1},\ldots,\beta_{m}\}\]

be ordered bases for \(V\) and \(W\), respectively. For each pair of integers \((p,q)\) with \(1\leq p\leq m\) and \(1\leq q\leq n\), we define a linear transformation \(E^{p,q}\) from \(V\) into \(W\) by

\[\begin{array}{ll}E^{
