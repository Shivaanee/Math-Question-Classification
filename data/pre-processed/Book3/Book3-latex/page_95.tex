**2.** Let \(V\) be a vector space over the field of complex numbers, and suppose there is an isomorphism \(T\) of \(V\) onto \(C^{3}\). Let \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4}\) be vectors in \(V\) such that

\[T\alpha_{1} = (1,0,i),\qquad T\alpha_{2}=(-2,1+i,0),\] \[T\alpha_{3} = (-1,1,1),\qquad T\alpha_{4}=(\sqrt{2},i,3).\]

1. Is \(\alpha_{1}\) in the subspace spanned by \(\alpha_{2}\) and \(\alpha_{3}\)?
2. Let \(W_{1}\) be the subspace spanned by \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\), and let \(W_{2}\) be the subspace spanned by \(\alpha_{3}\) and \
