over \(R\), with values in \(R\), such that \(D(AB)=D(A)D(B)\) for all \(A\), \(B\). Suppose also that

\[D\left(\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\ 1&0\end{bmatrix}\right)\neq D\left(\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\right).\]

Prove the following.

1. \(D(0)=0\);
2. \(D(A)=0\) if \(A^{\ast}=0\);
3. \(D(B)=-D(A)\) if \(B\) is obtained by interchanging the rows (or columns) of \(A\);
4. \(D(A)=0\) if one row (or one column) of \(A\) is \(0\);
5. \(D(A)=0\) whenever \(A\) is singular.

Let \(A\) be a \(2\times 2\) matrix over a field \(F\). Then the set of all matrices of the form \(f(A)\), where \(f\) is a polynomial over \(F\), is a commutative ring \(K\) with identity. If \(B\) is a \(2\times 2\) matrix over \(K\), the determinant of \(B\) is then a \(2\times 2\) matrix over \(F\), of the form \(f(
