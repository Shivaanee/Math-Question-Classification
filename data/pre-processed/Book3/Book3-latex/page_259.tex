\(A\) and \(B\) be \(n\times n\) matrices over the field \(F\) which have the _same_ characteristic polynomial

\[f=(x-c_{1})^{d_{1}}\cdots(x-c_{k})^{d_{k}}\]

and the same minimal polynomial. If no \(d_{i}\) is greater than 3, then \(A\) and \(B\) are similar.

**3.**: If \(A\) is a complex \(5\times 5\) matrix with characteristic polynomial

\[f=(x-2)^{d}(x+7)^{2}\]

and minimal polynomial \(p=(x-2)^{k}(x+7)\), what is the Jordan form for \(A\)?

**4.**: How many possible Jordan forms are there for a \(6\times 6\) complex matrix with characteristic polynomial \((x+2)^{d}(x-1)^{2}\)?

**5.**: The differentiation operator on the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to 3 is represented in the 'natural' ordered basis by the matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0&0\\ 0&0&2&0\\ 0&0&0&3\\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}.\]

What is the Jordan form of this matrix? (\(F\) a subfield of the complex numbers.)

**6.**: Let \(A\) be the complex matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}2&0&0&0&0&0\\ 1&2&0&0&0&0\\ -1&0&2&0&0&0\\ 0&1&0&2&0&0\\ 1&1&1&1&2&0\\ 0&0&0&0&1&-1\end{bmatrix}.\]

Find the Jordan form for \(A\).

**7.**: If \(A\) is an \(n\times n\) matrix over the field \(F\) with characteristic polynomial

\[f=(x-c_{1})^{d_{1}}\cdots(x-c_{k})^{d_{k}}\]

what is the trace of \(A\)?

**8.**: Classify up to similarity all \(3\times 3\) complex matrices \(A\) such that \(A^{3}=I\).

**9.**: Classify up to similarity all \(n\times n\) complex matrices \(A\) such that \(A^{n}=I\).

**10.**: Let \(n\) be a positive integer, \(n\geq 2\), and let \(N\) be an \(n\times n\) matrix over the field \(F\) such that \(N^{n}=0\) but \(N^{n\to 1}\neq 0\). Prove that \(N\) has no square root, i.e., that there is no \(n\times n\) matrix \(A\) such that \(A^{2}=N\).

**11.**: Let \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) be \(6\times 6\) nilpotent matrices over the field \(F\). Suppose that \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) have the same minimal polynomial and the same nullity. Prove that \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) are similar. Show that this is not true for \(7\times 7\) nilpotent matrices.

**12.**: Use the result of Exercise 11 and the Jordan form to prove the following: Let \(A\) and \(B\) be \(n\times n\) matrices over the field \(F\) which have the same characteristic polynomial

\[f=(x-c_{1})^{d_{1}}\cdots(x-c_{k})^{d_{k}}\]
