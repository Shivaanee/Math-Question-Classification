\(\mathbf{Lemma}\).: _If_ W _is an invariant subspace for_ T_, then_ W _is invariant under every polynomial in_ T_. Thus, for each_ \(\alpha\) _in_ V_, the conductor_ S(\(\alpha\); W) _is an ideal in the polynomial algebra_ F[x].

Proof.: If \(\beta\) is in \(W\), then _T\(\beta\)_ is in \(W\). Consequently, _T_(_T\(\beta\)_) = _T\({}^{*}\beta\)_ is in \(W\). By induction, _T\({}^{*}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
