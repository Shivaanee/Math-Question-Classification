let \(A_{ij}\), \(\ldots\), \(A_{mj}\) be the coordinates of the vector \(T\alpha_{j}\) in the ordered basis \(\otimes^{\prime}\), i.e.,

\[T\alpha_{j}=\sum_{p=1}^{m}A_{pj}\beta_{p}.\]

We wish to show that

\[T=\sum_{p=1}^{m}\sum_{q=1}^{n}A_{pq}E^{p.q}.\]

Let \(U\) be the linear transformation in the right-hand member of (3-2). Then for each \(j\)

\[U\alpha_{j} =\sum_{p}\sum_{q}A_{pq}E^{p.q}(\alpha_{j})\] \[=\sum_{p}\sum_{q}A_{pq}\delta_{jq}\beta_{p}\] \[=\sum_{p=1}^{m}A_{pj}\beta_{p}\] \[=T\alpha_{j}\]

and consequently \(U=T\). Now (3-2) shows that the \(E^{p.q}\) span \(L(V,\,W)\); we must prove that they are independent. But this is clear from what
