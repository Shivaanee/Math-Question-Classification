If \(B\) is an element of \(V\), let \(L_{B}\), \(R_{B_{1}}\) and \(T_{B}\) denote the linear operators on \(V\) defined by

1. \(L_{B}(A)\) = \(BA\).
2. \(R_{B}(A)\) = \(AB\).
3. \(T_{B}(A)\) = \(BA\) - \(AB\).

Consider the three families of operators obtained by letting \(B\) vary over all diagonal matrices. Show that each of these families is a commutative self-adjoint algebra and find their spectral resolutions.

**8.**: If \(B\) is an arbitrary member of the inner product space in Exercise 7, show that \(L_{B}\) is unitarily equivalent to \(R_{B}\).
**9.**: Let \(V\) be the inner product space in Exercise 7 and \(G\) the group of unitary matrices in \(V\). If \(B\) is in \(G\), let \(C_{B}\) denote the linear operator on \(V\) defined by

\[C_{B}(A)=BAB^{-1}.\]

Show that

1. \(C_{B}\) is a unitary operator on \(V\);
2. \(C_{B_{1}B_{1}}=C_{B_{1}C_{B_{1}}}\);
3. there is no unitary transformation \(U\) on \(V\) such that \[UL_{B}U^{-1}=C_{B}\] for all \(B\) in
