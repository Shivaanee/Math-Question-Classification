The claim is that \(\langle f_{k+1},\,.\,.\,.\,.\,,f_{n}\rangle\) is a basis for the annihilator \(W^{0}\). Certainly \(f_{i}\) belongs to \(W^{0}\) for \(i\geq k+1\), because

\[f_{i}(\alpha_{i})\,=\,\delta_{ij}\]

and \(\delta_{ij}=0\) if \(i\geq k+1\) and \(j\leq k\); from this it follows that, for \(i\geq k+1\), \(f_{i}(\alpha)\,=\,0\) whenever \(\alpha\) is a linear combination of \(\alpha_{1}\), \(.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{k}\). The functionals \(f_{k+1},.\,
