Let \(W\) be the null space of \(T-2I.\) Prove that \(W\) has no complementary \(T\)-invariant subspace. (_Hint:_ Let \(\beta=\epsilon_{i}\) and observe that \((T-2I)\#\) is in \(W.\) Prove there is no \(\alpha\) in \(W\) with \((T-2I)\beta=(T-2I)\alpha.)\)

Let \(T\) be the linear operator on \(F^{4}\) which is represented in the standard ordered basis by the matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}c&0&0&0\\ 1&c&0&0\\ 0&1&c&0\\ 0&0&1&c\end{bmatrix}.\]

Let \(W\) be the null space of \(T-cI.\)

1. Prove that \(W\) is the subspace spanned by \(\epsilon_{i}.\)
2. Find the monic generators of the ideals \(S(\epsilon_{i};W),\)\(S(\epsilon_{i};W),\)\(S(\epsilon_{i};W),\)\(S(\epsilon_{i};W).\)

Let \(T\) be a linear operator on the vector space \(V\) over the field \(F.\) If \(f\) is a polynomial over \(F\) and \(\alpha\) is in \(V,\) let \(f\alpha=f(T)\alpha.\) If \(V_{1},\)\(\ldots,\)\(V
