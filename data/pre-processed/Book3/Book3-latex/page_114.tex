The dimension of \(W^{\bullet}\) is 2 and a basis \(\langle f_{1},f_{2}\rangle\) for \(W^{0}\) can be found by first taking \(a=1\), \(b=0\) and then \(a=0\), \(b=1\):

\[\begin{array}{l}f_{1}(x_{1},\ .\ .\ .\ ,\ x_{4})=x_{1}+x_{2}\\ f_{2}(x_{1},\ .\ .\ .\ ,\ x_{5})=x_{1}-2x_{3}+x_{4}.\end{array}\]

The above general \(f\) in \(W^{0}\) is \(f=\,qf_{1}+\,bf_{2}\).

### Exercises

1. In \(R^{3}\), let \(\alpha_{1}=(1,\,0,\,1)\), \(\alpha_{2}=(0,\,1,\,-2)\), \(\alpha_{3}=(-1,\,-1,\,0)\).

1. If \(f\) is a linear functional on \(R^{3}\) such that \[f(\alpha_{1})=1,\ \ \ \ \ f(\alpha_{3})=-1,\ \ \ \ \ f(\alpha_{3})=3,\] and if \(\alpha=(a,\,b,\,c)\), find \(f(\alpha)\).
