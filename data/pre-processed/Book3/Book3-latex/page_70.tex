\[\begin{array}{l}\alpha_{1}=\ (1,\,2,\,2,\,1)\\ \alpha_{2}=\ (0,\,2,\,0,\,1)\\ \alpha_{3}=\ (-2,\,0,\,-4,\,3).\end{array}\]

* Prove that \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{2}\), \(\alpha_{3}\) form a basis for \(W\), i.e., that these vectors are linearly independent.
* Let \(\beta=(b_{1},b_{2},\,b_{3},\,b_{4})\) be a vector in \(W\). What are the coordinates of \(\beta\) relative to the ordered basis \(\{\alpha_{1},\,\alpha_{2},\,\alpha_{3}\}\)?
* Let \[\begin{array}{l}\alpha_{1}^{\prime}=\ (1,\,0,\,2,\,0)\\ \alpha_{2}^{\prime}=\ (0,\,2,\,0,\,1)\\ \alpha_{3}^{\prime}=\ (0,\,0,\,0,\,3).\end{array}\]

Show that \(\alpha_{1}^{\prime}\), \(\alpha_{2}^{\prime}\), \(\alpha_{3}^{\prime}\) form a basis for \(W\).

* If \(\beta\) is in \(W\), let \(X\) denote the coordinate matrix of \(\beta\
