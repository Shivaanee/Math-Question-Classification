\[f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4})=c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2}+c_{3}x_{3}+c_{4}x_{4}\]

are in the annihilator of \(W\)?

**8.**: Let \(W\) be the subspace of \(R^{s}\) which is spanned by the vectors

\[\begin{array}{l}\alpha_{1}=\epsilon_{1}+2\epsilon_{2}+\epsilon_{3},\qquad \alpha_{2}=\epsilon_{2}+3\epsilon_{2}+3\epsilon_{4}+\epsilon_{5}\\ \alpha_{3}=\epsilon_{1}+4\epsilon_{2}+6\epsilon_{3}+4\epsilon_{4}+\epsilon_{5} \end{array}\]

Find a basis for \(W^{0}\).

**9.**: Let \(V\) be the vector space of all \(2\times 2\) matrices over the field of real numbers, and let

\[B=\begin{bmatrix}2&-2\\ -1&1\end{bmatrix}.\]

Let \(W\) be the subspace of \(V\) consisting of all \(A\) such that \(AB=0\). Let \(f\) be a linear functional on \(V\) which is in the annihilator of \(W\). Suppose that \(f(I)=0\) and \(f(C)=3\), where \(I\) is the \(2\times 2\) identity matrix and

\[C=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}.\]

Find \(f(B)\).

**10.**: Let \(F\) be a subfield of the complex numbers. We define \(n\) linear functionals on \(F^{n}\) (\(n\geq 2\)) by

\[f_{k}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}\ (k-j)x_{i},\qquad 1\leq k \leq n.\]

What is the dimension of the subspace annihilated by \(f_{1},\ldots,f_{n}\)?

**11.**: Let \(W_{1}\) and \(W_{2}\) be subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space \(V\).

1. Prove that \((W_{1}+W_{2})^{0}=W_{1}^{0}\cap W_{2}^{0}\).

**12.**: Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\) and let \(W\) be a subspace of \(V\). If \(f\) is a linear functional on \(W\), prove that there is a linear functional \(g\) on \(V\) such that \(g(\alpha)=f(\alpha)\) for each \(\alpha\) in the subspace \(W\).

**13.**: Let \(F\) be a subfield of the field of complex numbers and let \(V\) be any vector space over \(F\). Suppose that \(f\) and \(g\) are linear functionals on \(V\) such that the function \(h\) defined by \(h(\alpha)=f(\alpha)g(\alpha)\) is also a linear functional on \(V\). Prove that either \(f=0\) or \(g=0\).

**14.**: Let \(F\) be a field of characteristic zero and let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over \(F\). If \(\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{m}\) are finitely many vectors in \(V\), each different from the zero vector, prove that there is a linear functional \(f\) on \(V\) such that

\[f(\alpha_{i})\neq 0,\qquad i=1,\ldots,m.\]

**15.**: According to Exercise 3, similar matrices have the same trace. Thus we can define the trace of a linear operator on a finite-dimensional space to be the trace of any matrix which represents the operator in an ordered basis. This is well-defined since all such representing matrices for one operator are similar.

Now let \(V\) be the space of all \(2\times 2\) matrices over the field \(F\) and let \(P\) be a fixed \(2\times 2\) matrix. Let \(T\) be the linear operator on \(V\) defined by \(T(A)=PA\). Prove that trace \((T)=2\) trace \((P)\).
