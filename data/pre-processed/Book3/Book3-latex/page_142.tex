Every member of this ideal is divisible by \(d\); thus each of the polynomials \(p_{i}\) is divisible by \(d\). Now suppose \(f\) is a polynomial which divides each of the polynomials \(p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}\). Then there exist polynomials \(g_{1},\ldots,g_{n}\) such that \(p_{i}=f\mathfrak{s}_{i}\), \(1\leq i\leq n\). Also, since \(d\) is in the ideal

\[p_{1}F[x]+\cdots+p_{n}F[x],\]

there exist polynomials \(q_{1},\ldots,q_{n}\) in \(F[x]\) such that

\[d=p_{1}q_{1}+\cdots+p_{n}q_{n}.\]

Thus

\[d=f[g_{1}q_{1
