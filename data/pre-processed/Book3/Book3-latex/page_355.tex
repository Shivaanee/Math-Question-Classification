Now let \(r_{1}\), \(.\ .\ .\ ,r_{k}\) be all the roots of \(\mathfrak{F}\). Then for each pair of indices \((i,n)\) with \(i\neq n\), there is an operator \(T_{in}\) in \(\mathfrak{F}\) such that \(r_{i}(T_{in})\neq r_{n}(T_{in})\). Let \(a_{in}=r_{i}(T_{in})-r_{n}(T_{in})\) and \(b_{in}=r_{n}(T_{in})\). Then the linear operator

\[Q_{i}=\mathop{\Pi}\limits_{n\neq i}a_{in}^{-1}(T_{in}=b_{in}I)\]

is an element of the algebra \(\alpha\). We will show that \(Q_{i}=P_{i}\ (1\leq i\leq k)\). For this, suppose \(j\neq i\) and that \(\alpha
