\(\{\alpha_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{n}\}\) in which the matrix of \(T\) is upper-triangular. Hence,

\[f(\alpha_{i},\,\alpha_{j})\,=\,(T\alpha_{i}|\alpha_{j})\,=\,0\]

when \(j>k\).

**Definition.**_A form \(f\) on a real or complex vector space \(V\) is called_

**Hermitian** _if_

\[f(\alpha,\beta)\,=\,\overline{f(\beta,\,\alpha)}\]

_for all \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) in \(V\)._

If \(T\) is a linear operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space \(V\) and \(f\) is the form

\[f(\alpha,\,\beta)\,=\,(T\alpha|\beta)\]

then \(\overline{f(\beta,\,\alpha)}\,=\,(\alpha|T\beta)\,=\,(T^{*}\alpha|\beta)\); so \(f\) is Hermitian if and only if \(T\) is self-adjoint.

When \(f\) is Hermitian \(f(\alpha,\,\alpha)\) is real for every \(\alpha\), and on complex spaces this property
