**Example 3**: Let \(A\) be a fixed \(m\times n\) matrix with entries in the field \(F\). The function \(T\) defined by \(T(X)=AX\) is a linear transformation from \(F^{n\times 1}\) into \(F^{n\times 1}\). The function \(U\) defined by \(U(\alpha)=\alpha A\) is a linear transformation from \(F^{n}\) into \(F^{n}\).

**Example 4**: Let \(P\) be a fixed \(m\times m\) matrix with entries in the field \(F\) and let \(Q\) be a fixed \(n\times n\) matrix over
