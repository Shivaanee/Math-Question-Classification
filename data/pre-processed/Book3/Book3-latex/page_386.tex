1. \(f(\alpha_{i},\,\beta_{i})\,=\,1,\,j\,=\,1,\,.\,.\,.\,.\,\,k\).
2. \(f(\alpha_{i},\,\alpha_{j})\,=\,f(\beta_{i},\,\beta_{j})\,=\,f(\alpha_{i},\, \beta_{j})\,=\,0,\,i\neq j\).
3. If \(W_{j}\) is the two-dimensional subspace spanned by \(\alpha_{j}\) and \(\beta_{j}\), then \[V\,=\,W_{1}\bigoplus\,\cdots\,\bigoplus\,W_{k}\bigoplus\,W_{0}\]

where every vector in \(W_{0}\) is 'orthogonal' to all \(\alpha_{j}\) and \(\beta_{j}\), and the restriction of \(f\) to \(W_{0}\) is the zero form.

**Theorem 6**: _Let \(V\) be an \(n\)-dimensional vector space over a subfield of the complex numbers, and let \(f\) be a skew-symmetric bilinear form on \(V\). Then the rank \(r\) of \(f\) is even, and if \(r\,=\,2k\) there is an ordered basis for \(V\) in which the matrix of \(f\) is the direct sum of the \((n\,-\,r)\,\times\,(n\,-\,r)\) zero matrix and \(k\) copies of the \(2\,\times\,2\) matrix_

\[\begin{bmatrix}0&1^{\,-}\\ -1&0\end{bmatrix}.\]

Let \(\alpha_{1},\,\beta_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{k},\,\beta_{k}\) be vectors satisfying conditions (a), (b), and (c) above. Let \(\{\gamma_{1},\,.\,.\,,\,\gamma_{4}\}\) be any ordered basis for the subspace \(W_{0}\). Then

\[\mbox{\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\tiny$\mathcal{B}$}\,=\,\{\alpha_{1},\,\beta_{1},\, \alpha_{2},\,\beta_{3},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{k},\,\beta_{k},\,\gamma_{1},\,. \,.\,.\,,\,\gamma_{4}\}$}\]

is an ordered basis for \(V\). From (a), (b), and (c) it is clear that the matrix of \(f\) in the ordered basis \(\mbox{\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\tiny$\mathcal{B}$}\,}\) is the direct sum of the \((n\,-\,2k)\,\times\,(n\,-\,2k)\) zero matrix and \(k\) copies of the \(2\,\times\,2\) matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\ -1&0\end{bmatrix}.\]

Furthermore, it is clear that the rank of this matrix, and hence the rank of \(f\), is \(2k\).

One consequence of the above is that if \(f\) is a non-degenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear form on \(V\), then the dimension of \(V\) must be even. If \(\dim\,V=2k\), there will be an ordered basis \(\{\alpha_{1},\,\beta_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{k},\,\beta_{k}\}\) for \(V\) such that

\[f(\alpha_{i},\,\beta_{j})\,=\,\begin{cases}0,&i\neq j\\ 1,&i\,=j\end{cases}\]

\[f(\alpha_{i},\,\alpha_{j})\,=\,f(\beta_{i},\,\beta_{j})\,=\,0.\]

The matrix of \(f\) in this ordered basis is the direct sum of \(k\) copies of the \(2\,\times\,2\) skew-symmetric matrix (10-8). We obtain another standard form for the matrix of a non-degenerate skew-symmetric form if, instead of the ordered basis above, we consider the ordered basis

\[\{\alpha_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{k},\,\beta_{k},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,\beta_{1}\}.\]
