\[\begin{array}{ll}\alpha_{1}&=&(1,2,0,3,0)\\ \alpha_{2}&=&(0,0,1,4,0)\\ \alpha_{3}&=&(0,0,0,0,1).\end{array}\]

By Theorem 3, a vector \(\alpha\) is in the subspace \(W\) of \(F^{3}\) spanned by \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{2}\), \(\alpha_{3}\) if and only if there exist scalars \(c_{1}\), \(c_{2}\), \(c_{3}\) in \(F\) such that

\[\alpha\,=\,c_{1}\alpha_{1}+c_{2}\alpha_{2}+c_{3}\alpha_{3}.\]

Thus \(W\) consists of all vectors of the form

\[\alpha\,=\,(c_{1},2c_
