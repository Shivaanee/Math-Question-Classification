correspondence which \({{G}}\) determines between operators and matrices is not only a vector space isomorphism but also preserves products. A simple consequence of this is that the linear operator \(T\) is invertible if and only if \([T]_{{{G}}}\) is an invertible matrix. For, the identity operator \(I\) is represented by the identity matrix in any ordered basis, and thus

\[UT=TU=I\]

is equivalent to

\[[U]_{{{G}}}[T]_{{{G}}}=[T]_{{{G}}}[U]_{{{G}}}=I.\]

Of course, when \(T\) is invertible

\[[T^{-1}]_{{{G}}}=[T]_{{{G}}}{}^{1}.\]

Now we should like to inquire what happens to representing matrices when the ordered basis is changed. For the sake of simplicity, we shall consider this question only for linear operators on a space \(V\), so that we can use a single ordered basis. The specific question is this. Let \(T\) be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional space \(V\), and let

\[{{G}}=\{\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\}\quad\mbox{and}\quad{{G}}^{\prime}=\{ \alpha^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,\alpha^{\prime}_{n}\}\]

be two ordered bases for \(V\). How are the matrices \([T]_{{{G}}}\) and \([T]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}\) related? As we observed in Chapter 2, there is a unique (invertible) \(n\times n\) matrix \(P\) such that

\[[\alpha]_{{{G}}}=P[\alpha]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}\]

for every vector \(\alpha\) in \(V\). It is the matrix \(P=[P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}]\) where \(P_{j}=[\alpha^{\prime}_{j}]_{{{G}}}\). By definition

\[[T\alpha]_{{{G}}}=[T]_{{{G}}}[\alpha]_{{{G}}}.\]

Applying (3-7) to the vector \(T\alpha\), we have

\[[T\alpha]_{{{G}}}=P[T\alpha]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}.\]

Combining (3-7), (3-8), and (3-9), we obtain

\[[T]_{{{G}}}P[\alpha]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}=P[T\alpha]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}\]

or

\[P^{-1}[T]_{{{G}}}P[\alpha]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}=[T\alpha]_{{{G}}^{\prime}}\]

and so it must
