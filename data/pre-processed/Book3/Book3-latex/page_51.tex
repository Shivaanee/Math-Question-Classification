**Example 14**: _Let \(P\) be an invertible \(n\times n\) matrix with entries in the field \(F\). Then \(P_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(P_{n}\), the columns of \(P\), form a basis for the space of column matrices, \(F^{n\times 1}\). We see that as follows. If \(X\) is a column matrix, then_

\[PX=x_{1}P_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}P_{n}.\]

_Since \(PX=0\) has only the trivial solution \(X=0\), it follows that \(\left\{P_{1},\,\ldots\
