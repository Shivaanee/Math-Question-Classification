\[\begin{array}{rll}\mbox{\it The Jordan Form}&\mbox{\it 245}\\ \mbox{\it 0}&=&N(f_{i}\alpha_{i})\\ &=&Nf_{i}(N)\alpha_{i}\\ &=&(xf_{i})\alpha_{i}.\end{array}\]

Thus \(xf_{i}\) is divisible by \(x^{k_{i}}\), and since deg \(\langle f_{i}\rangle>k_{i}\) this means that

\[f_{i}\,=\,c_{i}x^{k_{i}-1}\]

where \(c_{i}\) is some scalar. But then

\[\alpha\,=\,c_{1}(
