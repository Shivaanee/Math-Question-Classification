\(p_{1}\cdots p_{n-1}\). This together with (4-16) shows that the factorization of \(f\) as a product of monic primes is unique up to the order of the factors.

In the above factorization of a given non-scalar monic polynomial \(f\), some of the monic prime factors may be repeated. If \(p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{r}\) are the distinct monic primes occurring in this factorization of \(f\), then

\[f=p_{1}^{n}p_{2}^{n}\cdots p_{r}^{n},\]

the exponent \(n_{i}\) being the number of times the prime \(p_{i}\) occurs in the
