We assert that \(M=F[x]\). For \(M\) contains

\[x^{2}+8x+16-x(x+2)=6x+16\]

and hence \(M\) contains \(6x+16-6(x+2)=4\). Thus the scalar polynomial \(1\) belongs to \(M\) as well as all its multiples.

**Theorem 7**.: _If \(F\) is a field, and \(M\) is any non-zero ideal in \(F[x]\), there is a unique monic polynomial \(d\) in \(F[x]\) such that \(M\) is the principal ideal generated by \(d\)._
