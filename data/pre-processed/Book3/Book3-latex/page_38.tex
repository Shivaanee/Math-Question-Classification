It is important to observe, as the definition states, that a vector space is a composite object consisting of a field, a set of 'vectors,' and two operations with certain special properties. The same set of vectors may be part of a number of distinct vector spaces (see Example 5 below). When there is no chance of confusion, we may simply refer to the vector space as \(V\), or when it is desirable to specify the field, we shall say \(V\) is a **vector space over the field \(F\)**. The name 'vector' is applied to the elements of the set \(V\) largely as a matter of convenience. The origin of the name is to be found in Example 1 below, but one should not attach too much significance to the name, since the variety of objects occurring as the vectors in \(V\) may not bear much resemblance to any preassigned concept of vector which the reader has. We shall try to indicate this variety by a list of examples; our list will be enlarged considerably as we begin to study vector spaces.

**Example 1**.: **The \(n\)-tuple space, \(F^{n}\)**. Let \(F\) be any field, and let \(V\) be the set of all \(n\)-tuples \(\alpha=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})\) of scalars \(x_{i}\) in \(F\). If \(\beta=(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n})\) with \(y_{i}\) in \(F\), the sum of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is defined by

\[\alpha+\beta=(x_{1}+y_{1},x_{2}+y_{2},\ldots,x_{n}+y_{n}).\]

The product of a scalar \(c\) and vector \(\alpha\) is defined by

\[c\alpha=(cx_{1},cx
