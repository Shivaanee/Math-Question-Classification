**8.**: Let \(A\) be a \(2\times 2\) matrix with real entries. For \(X\), \(Y\) in \(R^{2\times 1}\) let

\[f_{A}(X,Y)=Y^{t}AX.\]

Show that \(f_{A}\) is an inner product on \(R^{2\times 1}\) if and only if \(A=A^{t}\), \(A_{11}>0\), \(A_{21}>0\), and \(\det A>0\).

**9.**: Let \(V\) be a real or complex vector space with an inner product. Show that the quadratic form determined
