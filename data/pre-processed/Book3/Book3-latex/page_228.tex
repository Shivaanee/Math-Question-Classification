**4.** Let \(T\) be a linear operator on \(V.\) Suppose \(V=W_{1}\oplus\cdots\oplus W_{k_{i}}\) where each \(W_{i}\) is invariant under \(T.\) Let \(T_{i}\) be the induced (restriction) operator on \(W_{i}.\)

(a) Prove that \(\det\,(T)=\det\,(T_{1})\,\cdots\,\det\,(T_{k}).\)

(b) Prove that the characteristic polynomial for \(f\) is the product of the characteristic polynomials for \(f_{1},\,\ldots,f_{k}.\)

(c) Prove that the minimal polynomial for \(T\) is the least common multiple of the minimal polynomials for \(T_{1},\,\ldots,\,T_{k}.\) (\(Hint\): Prove and then use the corresponding facts about direct sums of matrices.)

**5.** Let \(T\) be the diagonalizable linear operator on \(R^{4}\) which we discussed in Example 3 of Section 6.2. Use the Lagrange polynomials to write the representing matrix \(A\) in the form \(A=E_{1}+2E_{2},\,E_{1}+E_{2}=I,\,E_{1}E_{2}=0.\)

**6.** Let \(A\) be the \(4\,\times 4\) matrix in Example 6 of Section 6.3. Find matrices \(E_{1},\,E_{2},\,E_{1}\) such that \(A=e_{1}E_{1}+e_{2}E_{2}+e_{3}E_{3},\,E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}=I,\) and \(E_{i}E_{j}=0,\,i\neq j.\)

**7.** In Exercises 5 and 6, notice that (for each \(i\)) the space of characteristic vectors associated with the characteristic value \(e_{i}\) is spanned by the column vectors of the various matrices \(E_{i}\) with \(j\neq i.\) Is that a coincidence?

**8.** Let \(T\) be a linear operator on \(V\) which commutes with every projection operator on \(V.\) What can you say about \(T?\)

**9.** Let \(V\) be the vector space of continuous real-valued functions on the interval \([-1,\,1]\) of the real line. Let \(W_{\epsilon}\) be the subspace of even functions, \(f(-x)=f(x),\) and let \(W_{\epsilon}\) be the subspace of odd functions, \(f(-x)=-f(x).\)

(a) Show that \(V=W_{\epsilon}\oplus W_{\epsilon}.\)

(b) If \(T\) is the indefinite integral operator

\[(T\!f)(x)=\int_{\bullet}^{x}f(t)\;dt\]

are \(W
