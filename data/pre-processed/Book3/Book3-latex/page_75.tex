2. The equation \(AX=Y\) has solutions \(X\) if and only if \[\begin{array}{rll}-y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}&=&0\\ -3y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{4}-y_{5}&=&0.\end{array}\]

### Exercises

1. Let \(s<n\) and \(\iota\) an \(s\times n\) matrix with entries in the field \(F\). Use Theorem 4 (not its proof) to show that there is a non-zero \(X\) in \(F^{\mathsf{w}\times\mathsf{i}}\) such that \(AX=0\).
2. Let \[\alpha_{1}=(1,1,-2,1),\qquad\alpha_{2}\simeq(3,0,4,-1),\qquad\alpha_{3}=(-1,2, 5,2).\] Let \[\alpha=(4,-5,9,-7),\qquad\beta=(3,1,-4,4),\qquad\gamma=(-1,1,0,1).\] 1. Which of the vectors \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\) are in the subspace of \(R^{4}\) spanned by the \(\alpha_{i}\)? 2. Which of the vectors \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\) are in the subspace
