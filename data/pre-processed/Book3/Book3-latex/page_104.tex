**1.** Let \(T\) be the linear operator on \(C^{2}\) defined by \(T(x_{1},x_{2})=(x_{1},0)\). Let \(\mathfrak{G}\) be the standard ordered basis for \(C^{2}\) and let \(\mathfrak{G}^{\prime}=\langle\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\rangle\) be the ordered basis defined by \(\alpha_{1}=(1,i)\), \(\alpha_{2}=(-i,2)\).

(a) What is the matrix of \(T\) relative to the pair \(\mathfrak{G}\), \(\mathfrak{G}^{\prime}\)?

(b) What is the matrix of \(T\) relative to the pair \(\mathfrak{G}^{\prime}\), \(\mathfrak{G}^{\prime}\)?

(c) What is the matrix of \(T\) in the ordered basis \(\mathfrak{G}^{\prime}\)?

(d) What is the matrix of \(T\) in the ordered basis \(\langle\alpha_{2},\alpha_{1}\rangle\)?

**2.** Let \(T\) be the linear transformation from \(R^{3}\) into \(R^{2}\) defined by

\[T(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(x_{1}+x_{2},2x_{3}
