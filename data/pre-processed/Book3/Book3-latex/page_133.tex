Throughout this section we shall assume \(F\) is a fixed field and that \(t_{0},t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}\) are \(n+1\)_distinct_ elements of \(F\). Let \(V\) be the subspace of \(F[x]\) consisting of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to \(n\) (together with the \(0\)-polynomial), and let \(L_{i}\) be the function from \(V\) into \(F\) defined for \(f\) in \(V\) by

\[L_{i}(f)=f(t_{i}),\qquad 0\leq i\leq n.\]

By part (i) of Theorem 2, each \(L_{i}\) is a linear functional on \(V\), and one of the things we intend to show is that the set consisting of \(L_{0},L_{1},\ldots,L_{n}\) is a basis for \(V^{*}\), the dual space of \(V\).

Of course in order that this be so, it is sufficient (cf. Theorem 15 of Chapter 3) that \
