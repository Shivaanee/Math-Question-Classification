### \(More\ on\ Forms\)

This section contains two results which give more detailed information about (sesqui-linear) forms.

**Theorem** 7.: _Let \(f\) be a form on a real or complex vector space \(V\) and \(\{\alpha_{1},\ \ldots,\ \alpha_{r}\}\) a basis for the finite-dimensional subspace \(W\) of \(V\). Let \(M\) be the \(r\times r\) matrix with entries_

\[M_{ik}=f(\alpha_{k},\alpha_{i})\]

_and \(W^{\prime}\) the set of all vectors \(\beta\) in \(V\) such that \(f(\alpha,\beta)=0\) for all \(\alpha\,i\) in \(W\). Then \(W^{\prime}\) is a subspace of \(V\), and \(W\cap W^{\prime}=\{0\}\) if and only if \(M\) is invertible. When this is the case, \(V=W+W^{\prime}\)._

Proof.: If \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) are vectors in \(W^{\prime}\) and \(c\) is a scalar, then for every \(\alpha\) in \(W\)

\[\begin{array}{rl}f(\alpha,c\beta+\gamma)&=&\not\exists(\alpha,\beta)+f( \alpha,\gamma)\\ &=&0.\end{array}\]

Hence, \(W^{\prime}\) is a subspace of \(V\).

Now suppose \(\alpha=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{r}x_{k}\alpha_{k}\) and that \(\beta=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{r}y_{j}\
