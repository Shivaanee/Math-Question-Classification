that \(G\) is hermitian, i.e., that \(G=G^{*}\); however, \(G\) is a rather special kind of hermitian matrix. For \(G\) must satisfy the additional condition

\[X^{*}GX>0,\qquad X\neq 0.\]

In particular, \(G\) must be invertible. For otherwise there exists an \(X\neq 0\) such that \(GX=0\), and for any such \(X\), (8-6) is impossible. More explicitly, (8-6) says that for any scalars \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) not all of which are \(0\)
