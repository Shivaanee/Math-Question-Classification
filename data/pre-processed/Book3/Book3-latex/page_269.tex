Since we are considering a row operation, let \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\alpha_{n}\) be the rows of \(M\) and let us employ the notation

\[D_{J}(\alpha_{i_{1}}\,\ldots\,,\,\alpha_{i_{k}})\,=\,D_{I,J}(M).\]

Given \(I\) and \(J\), what is the relation between \(D_{I,J}(M)\) and \(D_{I,J}(e(M))\)? Consider the three types of operations \(e\):

* multiplication of row \(r\) by a non-zero scalar \(c\);
* replacement of row \(r\) by row \(r\) plus \(g\) times row \(s\), \(r\neq s\);
* interchange of rows \(r\) and \(s\), \(r\neq s\).

Forget about type (c) operations for the moment, and concentrate on types (a) and (b), which change only row \(r\). If \(r\) is not one of the indices \(i_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(i_{k}\) then

\[D_{I,J}(e(M))\,=\,D_{I,J}(M).\]

If \(r\) is among the indices \(i_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(i_{k}\), then in the two cases we have

* \(D_{I,J}(e(M))\,=\,D_{J}(\alpha_{i_{1}}\,\ldots\,,\,\alpha_{r}\,,\,\ldots\,,\, \alpha_{i_{k
