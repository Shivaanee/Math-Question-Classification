This says that

\[T\left(\sum\limits_{i=k+1}^{n}c_{i}\alpha_{i}\right)=0\]

and accordingly the vector \(\alpha=\sum\limits_{i=k+1}^{n}c_{i}\alpha_{i}\) is in the null space of \(T.\) Since \(\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{k}\) form a basis for \(N,\) there must be scalars \(b_{1},\ldots,b_{k}\) such that

\[\alpha=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}b_{i}\alpha_{i}.\]

Thus

\[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k
