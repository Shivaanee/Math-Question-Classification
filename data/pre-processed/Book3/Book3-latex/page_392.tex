1. If \(M_{1}\) and \(M_{2}\) are invertible \(2\times 2\) matrices with complex entries, then \(U_{M_{1}}=U_{M_{1}}\) if and only if \(M_{2}\) is a scalar multiple of \(M_{1}\). Thus, all of the Lorentz transformations exhibited above are obtainable from unimodular matrices \(M\), that is, from matrices \(M\) satisfying det \(M=1\). If \(M_{1}\) and \(M_{2}\) are unimodular matrices such that \(M_{1}\neq M_{2}\) and \(M_{1}\neq-M_{2}\), then \(T_{M_{1}}\neq T_{M_{1}}\).
2. Not every Lorentz transformation is obtainable by the above method.

**4.** Let \(M\) be an \(n\times n\) matrix over \(C\) with columns \(M_{1}\), \(M_{1}\), ..., \(M_{n}\). Show that \(M\) belongs to \(O(n,C)\) if and only if

\[M^{\prime}_{j}M_{k}=\delta_{jk}.\]

**8.** Let \(X\) be an \(n\times 1\) matrix over \(C\) such that \(X^{\prime}X=1\), and \(I_{i}\) be the \(j\)th column of the identity matrix.

Show that \(f\) is invariant under \(O(n,C)\), i.e., \(f(MX,MY)=f(X,Y)\) for all \(X\), \(Y\) in \(V\) and \(M\) in \(O(n,C)\), if and only if \(A\) commutes with each member of \(O(n,C)\).
