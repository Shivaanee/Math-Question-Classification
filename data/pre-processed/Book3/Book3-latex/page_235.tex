* Prove that \(W_{i}\) is the set of all vectors \(\alpha\) in \(V\) such that \((T-c_{i}I)^{n}\alpha=0\) for some positive integer \(m\) (which may depend upon \(\alpha\)).
* Prove that the dimension of \(W_{i}\) is \(d_{i}\). (\(Hint\): If \(T_{i}\) is the operator induced on \(W_{i}\) by \(T\), then \(T_{i}-c_{i}I\) is nilpotent; thus the characteristic polynomial for \(T_{i}-c_{i}I\) must be \(x^{\epsilon_{i}}\) where \(\epsilon_{i}\) is the dimension of \(W_{i}\) (proof?); thus the characteristic polynomial of \(T_{i}\) is \((x-c_{i})^{\epsilon_{i}}\); now use the fact that the characteristic polynomial for \(T\) is the product of the characteristic polynomials of the \(T_{i}\) to show that \(e_{i}=d_{i}\).
* Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field of complex numbers. Let \(T\) be a linear operator on \(V\) and let \(D
