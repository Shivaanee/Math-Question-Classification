the projections associated with the decomposition \(V=W_{1}\oplus\cdots\oplus W_{k}\), then each \(E_{j}\) is a polynomial in \(T\). That is, there are polynomials \(h_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(h_{k}\) such that \(E_{j}=h_{j}(T)\).

Now let \(W\) be a subspace which is invariant under \(T\). If \(\alpha\) is any vector in \(W\), then \(\alpha=\alpha_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{k}\), where \(\alpha_{j}\) is in \(W_{j}\). Now \(\
