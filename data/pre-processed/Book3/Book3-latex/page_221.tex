a sum of vectors from the spaces \(W_{i}\) with \(i\neq j\). In terms of the projections \(E_{j}\) we have

\[\alpha\,=\,E_{1}\alpha\,+\,\cdots\,+\,E_{k}\alpha\]

for each \(\alpha\) in \(V\). What (6-13) says is that

\[I\,=\,E_{1}\,+\,\cdots\,+\,E_{k}.\]

Note also that if \(i\neq j\), then \(E_{i}E_{j}=0\), because the range of \(E_{j}\) is the subspace \(W_{j}
