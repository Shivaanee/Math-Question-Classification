Definition: Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let \(\mathbb{G}=\{\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}\}\) be an ordered basis for \(V\). If \(f\) is a bilinear form on \(V\), the **matrix of \(f\) in the ordered basis \(\mathbb{G}\)** is the \(n\times n\) matrix \(A\) with entries \(A_{ij}=f(\alpha_{i},\,\alpha_{i})\). At times, we shall denote this matrix by \([f]_{\mathbb{G}}\).

Theorem 1: Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field \(F\). For each ordered basis \(\mathbb{G}\) of \(V\), the function which associates with each bilinear form on \(V\) its matrix in the ordered basis \(\mathbb{G}\) is an isomorphism of the space \(L(V,\,V,\,F)\) onto the space of \(n\times n\) matrices over the field \(F\).

Proof: We observed above that \(f\mathop{\rightarrow}\limits[f]_{\mathbb{G}}\) is a one-one correspondence between the set of
