Evidently \(A-2I\) also has rank 2, so that the space of characteristic vectors associated with the characteristic value 2 has dimension 1. Evidently \(T\alpha=2\alpha\) if and only if \(\alpha\) is a scalar multiple of \(\alpha_{2}=(1,\,1,\,2)\).

_Definition. Let \(T\) be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional space . V. We say that \(T\) is_ **diagonalizable** _if there is a basis for \(V\) each vector of which is a characteristic vector of \(T\)._

The reason for the name should be apparent; for, if there is an ordered basis \(\mathfrak{G}=\{\alpha_{i},\,.\,.\,,\,\alpha_{n}\}\) for \(V\) in which each \(\alpha_{i}\) is a characteristic vector of \(T\), then the matrix of \(T\) in the ordered basis \(\mathfrak{G}\) is diagonal. If \(T\alpha_{i}=c_{i}\alpha_{i}\), then

\[[T]_{\mathfrak{G}}=\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&c_{2}&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&c_{n}\end{bmatrix}.\]

We certainly do not require that the
