and since \(T\to[T]_{\emptyset}\) is a linear mapping

\[[f(U)]_{\emptyset}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}c_{i}[U^{i}]_{\emptyset}.\]

Now from the additional fact that

\[[T_{1}T_{2}]_{\emptyset}=[T_{1}]_{\emptyset}[T_{2}]_{\emptyset}\]

for all \(T_{1}\), \(T_{2}\) in \(L(V,\,V)\) it follows that

\[[U^{i}]_{\emptyset}=([U]_{\emptyset})^{i},\ \ \ \ \ 2\leq i\leq n.\]

As this relation is also valid
