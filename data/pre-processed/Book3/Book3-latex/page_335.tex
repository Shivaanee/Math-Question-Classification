is a positive form on the space of \(n\times 1\) column matrices over the scalar field.

Let \(F\) be the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Let \(A\) be an \(n\times n\) matrix over \(F\). The function \(g\) defined by

\[g(X,\ Y)\,=\,Y^{*}AX\] (9-4)

is a positive form on the space \(F^{n\times 1}\) if and only if there exists an invertible \(n\times n\) matrix \(P\) with entries in \(F\) such that \(A\,=\,P^{*}P\).

For any \(n\times n\) matrix \(A\), the function \(g\) in (9-4) is a form on the space of column matrices. We are trying to prove that \(g\) is positive if and only if \(A\,=\,P^{*}P\). First, suppose \(A\,=\,P^{*}P\). Then \(g\) is Hermitian and

\[\begin{array}{rl}g(X,\,X)&=\,X^{*}P^{*}PX\\ &=\,(PX)^{*}PX\\ &\geq\,0.\end{array}\]

If \(P\) is invertible and \(X\neq 0\), then \((PX)^{*}PX>0\).

Now, suppose that \(g\) is a positive form on the space of column matrices. Then it is an inner product and hence there exist column matrices \(Q_{i}\), \(\ldots\), \(Q_{n}\) such that

\[\begin{array}{rl}\delta_{jk}&=\,g(Q_{i},\,Q_{k})\\ &=\,Q_{\ell}^{*}AQ_{j}.\end{array}\]

But this just says that, if \(Q\) is the matrix with columns \(Q_{i}\), \(\ldots\), \(Q_{n}\), then \(Q^{*}AQ=I\). Since \(\{Q_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(Q_{n}\}\) is a basis, \(Q\) is invertible. Let \(P\,=\,Q^{-1}\) and we have \(A\,=\,P^{*}P\).

In practice, it is not easy to verify that a given matrix \(A\) satisfies the criteria for positivity which we have given thus far. One consequence of the last theorem is that if \(g\) is positive then \(\det A>0\), because \(\det A\,=\,\det\,(P^{*}I^{\prime})\,=\,\det\,P^{*}\,\det I^{\prime}=|\det P|^{2
