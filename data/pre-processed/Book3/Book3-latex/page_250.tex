Since \(T\beta_{i}=c_{i}\beta_{i}\), we have

\[f(T)\alpha=f(c_{1})\beta_{1}+\;\cdots\;+f(c_{k})\beta_{k}\]

for every polynomial \(f\). Given any scalars \(t_{1},\,\ldots,\,t_{k}\) there exists a polynomial \(f\) such that \(f(c_{i})=t_{i}\), \(1\leq i\leq k\). Therefore, \(Z(\alpha;T)\) is just the subspace spanned by the vectors \(\beta_{1},\,\ldots,\,\beta_{k}
