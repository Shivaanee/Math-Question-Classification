Proof: Assume (a). Let \(\alpha\) be a vector in the intersection \(W_{j}\cap(W_{1}+\cdots+W_{j-1})\). Then there are vectors \(\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{j-1}\) with \(\alpha_{i}\) in \(W_{i}\) such that \(\alpha=\alpha_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{j-1}\). Since

\[\alpha_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{j-1}+(-\alpha)+0+\cdots+0=0\]

and since \(W_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(W_{k}\) are independent, it must be that \(\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=\cdots=\alpha_{j-1}=\alpha=0\
