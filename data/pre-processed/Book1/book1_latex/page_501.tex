43. If \(T\) is not invertible, then \(T(v_{1})\), ..., \(T(v_{n})\) will not be a basis. Then we couldn't choose \(w_{i}=T(v_{i})\) as output basis.
45. \(S(T(v))=(-1,\,2)\) but \(S(v)=(-2,\,1)\) and \(T(S(v))=(1,-2)\). So \(TS\neq ST\).
47. The Hadamard matrix \(H\) has orthogonal columns of length \(2\). So the inverse of \(H\) is \(H^{\mathrm{T}}/4=H/4\).
49. False: the \(n\) nonzero vectors would have to be independent.

**Problem Set 3.1, page 148**

1. \(\|x\|=\sqrt{21}\); \(\|y\|=3\sqrt{2}\); \(x^{\mathrm{T}}y=0\).
2. \((x_{2}/x_{1})(y_{2}/y_{1})=-1\) means that \(x_{1}y_{1}+x_{2}y_{2}=0\), so \(x^{\mathrm{T}}y=0\).
3. \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{3}\) are orthogonal, also \(v_{2}\) and \(v_{3}\).
