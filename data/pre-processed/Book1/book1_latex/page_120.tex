You must notice that the word "dimensional" is used in two different ways. We speak about a four-dimensional _vector_, meaning a vector in \(\mathbf{R}^{4}\). Now we have defined a four-dimensional _subspace_; an example is the set of vectors in \(\mathbf{R}^{6}\) whose first and last components are zero. The members of this four-dimensional subspace are six-dimensional vectors like \((0,5,1,3,4,0)\).

One final note about the language of linear algebra. We never use the terms "basis of a matrix" or "rank of a space" or "dimension of a basis." These phrases have no meaning. It is _the dimension of the column space that equals the rank of the matrix_, as we prove in the coming section.

### Problem Set 2.3

**Problems 1-10 are about linear independence and linear dependence.**

**1.** Show that \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\), \(v_{3}\) are independent but \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\), \(v_{3}\), \(v_{4}\) are dependent:

\[v_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad v_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\qquad v_{3}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 1\\ 1\end{bmatrix}\qquad v_{4}=\begin{bmatrix}2\\ 3\\ 4\end{bmatrix}.\]

Solve \(c_{1}v_{1}+\cdots+c_{4}v_{4}=0\) or \(Ac=0\). The \(v\)'s go in the columns of \(A\).

**2.** Find the largest possible number of independent vectors among

\[v_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ -1\\ 0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\quad v_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 0\\ -1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\quad v_{3}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 0\\ 0\\ -1\end{bmatrix}\quad v_{4}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 1\\ -1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\quad v_{5}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 1\\ 0\\ -1\end{bmatrix}\quad v_{6}=\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 0\\ 1\\ -1\end{bmatrix}.\]

This number is the \(\underline{\phantom{\text{\rm(\ref{eq:1})}}}\) of the space spanned by the \(v\)'s.

**3.** Prove that if \(a=0\), \(d=0\), or \(f=0\) (3 cases), the columns of \(U\) are dependent:

\[U=\begin{bmatrix}a&b&c\\ 0&d&e\\ 0&0&f\end{bmatrix}.\]

**4.** If \(a\), \(d\), \(f\) in Problem 3 are all nonzero, show that the only solution to \(Ux=0\) is \(x=0\). Then \(U\) has independent columns.

**5.** Decide the dependence or independence of

1. the vectors \((1,3,2)\), \((2,1,3)\), and \((3.2,1)\).
2. the vectors \((1,-3,2)\), \((2,1,-3)\), and \((-3,2,1)\).
