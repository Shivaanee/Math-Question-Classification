**4.**: Describe the four subspaces in three-dimensional space associated with

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0\\ 0&0&1\\ 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}.\]
**5.**: If the product \(AB\) is the zero matrix, \(AB=0\), show that the column space of \(B\) is contained in the nullspace of \(A\). (Also the row space of \(A\) is in the left nullspace of \(B\), since each row of \(A\) multiplies \(B\) to give a zero row.)
**6.**: Suppose \(A\) is an \(m\) by \(n\) matrix of rank \(r\). Under what conditions on those numbers does

(a) \(A\) have a two-sided inverse: \(AA^{-1}=A^{-1}A=I\)?

(b) \(Ax=b\) have _infinitely many solutions_ for _every_\(b\)?
**7.**: Why is there no matrix whose row space and nullspace both contain \((1,1,1)\)?
**8.**: Suppose the only solution to \(Ax=0\) (\(m\) equations in \(n\) unknowns) is \(x=0\). What is the rank and why? The columns of \(A\) are linearly .
**9.**: Find a 1 by 3 matrix whose nullspace consists of all vectors in \(\mathbf{R}^{3}\) such that \(x_{1}+2x_{2}+4x_{3}=0\). Find a 3 by 3 matrix with that same nullspace.
**10.**: If \(Ax=b\) always has at least one solution, show that the only solution to \(A^{\mathrm{T}}y=0\) is \(y=0\). _Hint_: What is the rank?
**11.**: If \(Ax=0\) has a nonzero solution, show that \(A^{\mathrm{T}}y=f\) fails to be solvable for some right-hand sides \(f\). Construct an example of \(A\) and \(f\).
**12.**: Find the rank of \(A\) and write the matrix as \(A=uv^{\mathrm{T}}\):

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&3\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 2&0&0&6\end{bmatrix}\qquad\text{and}\qquad A=\begin{bmatrix}2&-2\\ 6&-6\end{bmatrix}.\]
**13.**: If \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) are given with \(a\neq 0\), choose \(d\) so that

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{bmatrix}=uv^{\mathrm{T}}\]

has rank 1. What are the pivots?
**14.**: Find a left-inverse and/or a right-inverse (when they exist) for

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&0\\ 0&1&1\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad M=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 1&1\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad T=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\ 0&a\end{bmatrix}.\]
