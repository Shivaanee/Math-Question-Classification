**3.35**: To solve a rectangular system \(Ax=b\), we replace \(A^{-1}\) (which doesn't exist) by \((A^{\rm T}A)^{-1}A^{\rm T}\) (which exists if \(A\) has independent columns). Show that this is a left-inverse of \(A\) but not a right-inverse. On the left of \(A\) it gives the identity; on the right it gives the projection \(P\).
**3.36**: Find the straight line \(C+Dt\) that best fits the measurements \(b=0,1,2,5\) at times \(t=0,1,3,4\).
**3.37**: Find the curve \(y=C+D2^{t}\) which gives the best least-squares fit to the measurements \(y=6\) at \(t=0\), \(y=4\) at \(t=1\), \(y=0\) at \(t=2\). Write the three equations that are solved if the curve goes through the three points, and find the best \(C\) and \(D\).
**3.38**: If the columns of \(A\) are orthogonal to each other what can you say about the form of \(A^{\rm T}A\)? If the columns are orthonormal, what can you say then?
**3.39**: Under what condition on the columns of \(A\) (which may be rectangular) is \(A^{\rm T}A\) invertible?
