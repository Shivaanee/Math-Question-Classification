**15.**: If rows 1 and 2 are the same, how far can you get with elimination (allowing row exchange)? If columns 1 and 2 are the same, which pivot is missing?

\[2x-y+z=0 2x+2y+z=0\] \[2x-y+z=0 4x+4y+z=0\] \[4x+y+z=2 6x+6y+z=2.\]
**16.**: Construct a 3 by 3 example that has 9 different coefficients on the left-hand side, but rows 2 and 3 become zero in elimination. How many solutions to your system with \(b=(1,10,100)\) and how many with \(b=(0,0,0)\)?
**17.**: Which number \(q\) makes this system singular and which right-hand side \(t\) gives it infinitely many solutions? Find the solution that has \(z=1\).

\[x + 4y - 2z = 1\] \[x + 7y - 6z = 6\] \[3y + qz = t.\]
**18.**: (Recommended) It is impossible for a system of linear equations to have exactly two solutions. _Explain why_.

1. If \((x,y,z)\) and \((X,Y,Z)\) are two solutions, what is another one?
2. If 25 planes meet at two points, where else do they meet?
**19.**: Three planes can fail to have an intersection point, when no two planes are parallel. The system is singular if row 3 of \(A\) is a \(\underline{\
