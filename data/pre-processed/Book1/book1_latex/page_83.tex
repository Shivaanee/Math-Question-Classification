* Compute the products \(AB\) and \(BA\) and \(A^{2}\).
* For the matrices \[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 2&1\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad B=\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix},\] compute \(AB\) and \(BA\) and \(A^{-1}\) and \(B^{-1}\) and \((AB)^{-1}\).
* Find examp1es of 2 by 2 matrices with \(a_{12}=\frac{1}{2}\) for which (a) \(A^{2}=I\). (b) \(A^{-1}=A^{\text{T}}\). (c) \(A^{2}=A\).
* Solve by elimination and back-substitution: \[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}u&&+&w&=&4\\ u&+&v&&=&3\\ u&+&v&+&w&=&6\end{array}\qquad\text{and}\qquad\qquad\begin{array}{ccccc}v&+&w&=& 0\\ u&&+&w&=&0\\ u&+&v&&=&6.\end{array}\]
* Factor the preceding matrices into \(A=LU\) or \(PA=LU\).
* There are sixteen 2 by 2 matrices whose entries are 1s and 0s. How many are invertible?
* (Much harder!) If you put 1s and 0s at random into the entries of a 10 by 10 matrix, is it more likely to be invertible or singular?
* There are sixteen 2 by 2 matrices whose entries are 1s and \(-1\)s. How many are invertible?
* How are the rows of \(EA\) related to the rows of \(A\) in the following cases? \[E=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 0&2&0\\ 4&0&1\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{or}\quad E=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&1\\ 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{or}\quad E=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&1\\ 0&1&0\\ 1&0&0\end{bmatrix}.\]
* Write down a 2 by 2 system with infinitely many solutions.
* Find inverses if they exist, by inspection or by Gauss-Jordan: \[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&1\\ 1&1&0\\ 0&1&1\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad A=\begin{bmatrix}2&1&0\\ 1&2&1\\ 0&1&2\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad A=\begin{bmatrix}1&1&-2\\ 1&-2&1\\ -2&1&1\end{bmatrix}\]
* If \(E\) is 2 by 2 and it adds the first equation to the second, what are \(E^{2}\) and \(E^{8}\) and \(8E\)?
* True or false, with _reason_ if true or _counterexample_ if false:
* If \(A\) is invertible and its rows are in reverse order in \(B\), then \(B\) is invertible.
