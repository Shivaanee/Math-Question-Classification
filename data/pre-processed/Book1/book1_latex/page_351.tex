**5.1**: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the diagonalizing matrix \(S\), for

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\ 2&3\end{bmatrix}\qquad\text{and}\qquad B=\begin{bmatrix}7&2\\ -15&-4\end{bmatrix}.\]
**5.2**: Find the determinants of \(A\) and \(A^{-1}\) if

\[A=S\begin{bmatrix}\lambda_{1}&2\\ 0&\lambda_{2}\end{bmatrix}S^{-1}.\]
**5.3**: If \(A\) has eigenvalues \(0\) and \(1\), corresponding to the eigenvectors

\[\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}\qquad\text{and}\qquad\begin{bmatrix}2\\ -1\end{bmatrix},\]

how can you tell in advance that \(A\) is symmetric? What are its trace and determinant? What is \(A\)?
**5.4**: In the previous problem, what will be the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \(A^{2}\)? What is the relation of \(A^{2}\) to \(A\)?
**5.5**: Does there exist a matrix \(A\) such that the entire family \(A+cI\) is invertible for all complex numbers \(c\)? Find a real matrix with \(A+rI\) invertible for all real \(r\).
**5.6**: Solve for both initial values and then find \(e^{At}\):

\[\frac{du}{dt}=\begin{bmatrix}3&1\\ 1&3\end{bmatrix}u\quad\text{if}\quad u(0)=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and if}\quad u(0)=\begin{bmatrix}0\\ 1\end{bmatrix}.\]
**5.7**: Would you prefer to have interest compounded quarterly at \(40\%\) per year, or annually at \(50\%\)?
**5.8**: True or false (with counterexample if false):

1. If \(B\) is formed from \(A\) by exchanging two rows, then \(B\) is similar to \(A\).
2. If a triangular matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix, it is already diagonal.
3. Any two of these statements imply the third: \(A\) is Hermitian, \(A\) is unitary, \(A^{2}=I\).
4. If \(A\) and \(B\) are diagonalizable, so is \(AB\).
**5.9**: What happens to the Fibonacci sequence if we go backward in time, and how is \(F_{-k}\) related to \(F_{k}\)? The law \(F_{k+2}=F_{k+1}+F_{k}\) is still in force, so \(F_{-1}=1\).
**5.10**: Find the general solution to \(du/dt=Au\) if
