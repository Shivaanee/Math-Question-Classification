**23.**: For the system

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}u&+&v&+&w&=&2\\ u&+&3v&+&3w&=&0\\ u&+&3v&+&5w&=&2,\end{array}\]

what is the triangular system after forward elimination, and what is the solution?
**24.**: Solve the system and find the pivots when

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}2u&-&v&&&&&=&0\\ -u&+&2v&-&w&&=&0\\ &-&v&+&2w&-&z&=&0\\ &&&-&w&+&2z&=&5.\end{array}\]

You may carry the right-hand side as a fifth column (and omit writing \(u\), \(v\), \(w\), \(z\) until the solution at the end).
**25.**: Apply elimination to the system

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}u&+&v&+&w&=&-2\\ 3u&+&3v&-&w&=&6\\ u&-&v&+&w&=&-1.\end{array}\]

When a zero arises in the pivot position, exchange that equation for the one below it and proceed. What coefficient of \(v\) in the third equation, in place of the present \(-1\), would make it impossible to proceed--and force elimination to break down?
**26.**: Solve by elimination the system of two equations

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}x&-&y&=&0\\ 3x&+&6y&=&18.\end{array}\]

Draw a graph representing each equation as a straight line in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane; the lines intersect at the solution. Also, add one more line--the graph of the new second equation which arises after elimination.
**27.**: Find three values of \(a\) for which elimination breaks down, temporarily or permanently, in

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}au&+&u&=&1\\ 4u&+&av&=&2.\end{array}\]

Breakdown at the first step can be fixed by exchanging rows--but not breakdown at the last step.
**28.**: True or false:

1. If the third equation starts with a zero coefficient (it begins with \(0u\)) then no multiple of equation 1 will be subtracted from equation 3.
