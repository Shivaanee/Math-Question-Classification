These are the same three equations in two unknowns. Now the problem is: Find numbers \(u\) and \(v\) that multiply the first and second columns to produce \(b\). The system is solvable exactly when such coefficients exist, and the vector \((u,v)\) is the solution \(x\).

We are saying that the attainable right-hand sides \(b\) are _all combinations of the columns of \(A\)_. One possible right-hand side is the first column itself; the weights are \(u=1\) and \(v=0\). Another possibility is the second column: \(u=0\) and \(v=1\). A third is the right-hand side \(b=0\). With \(u=0\) and \(v=0\), the vector \(b=0
