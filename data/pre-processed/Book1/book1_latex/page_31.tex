2. If the third equation has zero as its second coefficient (it contains \(0v\)) then no multiple of equation 2 will be subtracted from equation 3. 3. If the third equation contains \(0u\)_and_\(0v\), then no multiple of equation 1 or equation 2 will be subtracted from equation 3.
**29.**: (Very optional) Normally the multiplication of two complex numbers

\[(a+ib)(c+id)=(ac-bd)+i(bc+ad)\]

involves the four separate multiplications \(ac\), \(bd\), \(be\), \(ad\). Ignoring \(i\), can you compute \(ac-bd\) and \(bc+ad\) with only three multiplications? (You may do additions, such as forming \(a+b\) before multiplying, without any penalty.)
**30.**: Use elimination to solve

\[\begin{array}{
