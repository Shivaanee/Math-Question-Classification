the coefficient \(\widehat{x}\). All we need is the geometrical fact that _the line from \(b\) to the closest point \(p=\widehat{x}a\) is perpendicular to the vector \(a\)_:

\[(b-\widehat{a})\bot a,\quad\mbox{or}\quad a^{\rm T}(b-\widehat{a})=0,\quad \mbox{or}\quad\widehat{x}=\frac{a^{\rm T}b}{a^{\rm T}a}.\] (4)

That gives the formula for the number \(\widehat{x}\) and the projection \(p\):
