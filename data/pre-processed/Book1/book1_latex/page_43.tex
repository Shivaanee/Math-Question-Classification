**32.**: Write these ancient problems in a 2 by 2 matrix form \(Ax=b\) and solve them:

1. \(X\) is twice as old as \(Y\) and their ages add to 39,
2. \((x,y)=(2,5)\) and \((3,7)\) lie on the line \(y=mx+c\). Find \(m\) and \(c\).
**33.**: The parabola \(y=a+bx+cx^{2}\) goes through the points \((x,y)=(1,4)\) and \((2,8)\) and \((3,14)\). Find and solve a matrix equation for the unknowns \((a,b,c)\).
**34.**: Multiply these matrices in the orders \(EF\) and \(FE\) and \(E^{2}\):

\[E=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ a&1&0\\ b&0&1\end{bmatrix}\qquad\qquad F=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 0&1&0\\ 0&c&1\end{bmatrix}.\]
**35.**:
1. Suppose all columns of \(B\) are the same. Then all columns of \(EB\) are the same, because each one is \(E\) times .
2. Suppose all rows of \(B\) are \([1\ \ 2\ \ 4]\). Show by example that all rows of \(EB\) are _not_\([1\ \ 2\ \ 4]\). It is true that those rows are .
**36.**: If \(E\) adds row 1 to row 2 and \(F\) adds row 2 to row 1, does \(EF\) equal \(FE\)?
**37.**: The first component of \(Ax\) is \(\sum a_{1j}x_{j}=a_{11}x_{1}+\cdots+a_{1n}x_{n}\). Write formulas for the third component of \(Ax\) and the \((1,1)\) entry of \(A^{2}\).
**38.**: If \(AB=I\) and \(BC=I\), use the associative law to prove \(A=C\).
**39.**: \(A\) is 3 by 5, \(B\) is 5 by 3, \(C\) is 5 by 1, and \(D\) is 3 by 1. _All entries are_ 1. Which of these matrix operations are allowed, and what are the results?

\[BA\qquad AB\qquad ABD\qquad DBA\qquad A(B+C).\]
**40.**: What rows or columns or matrices do you multiply to find

1. the third column of \(AB\)?
2. the first row of \(AB\)?
3. the entry in row 3, column 4 of \(AB\)?
4. the entry in row 1, column 1 of \(CDE\)?
**41.**: (3 by 3 matrices) Choose the only \(B\) so that for every matrix \(A\),

1. \(BA=4A\).
2. \(BA=4B\).
3. \(BA\) has rows 1 and 3 of \(A\) reversed and row 2 unchanged.
4. All rows of \(BA\) are the same as row 1 of \(A\).
**42.**: True or false?
