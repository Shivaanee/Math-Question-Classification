**5.**: With \(h=\frac{1}{4}\) and \(f(x)=4\pi^{2}\sin 2\pi x\), the difference equation (5) is

\[\begin{bmatrix}2&-1&0\\ -1&2&-1\\ 0&-1&2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}u_{1}\\ u_{2}\\ u_{3}\end{bmatrix}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{4}\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 0\\ -1\end{bmatrix}.\]

Solve for \(u_{1}\), \(u_{2}\), \(u_{3}\) and find their error in comparison with the true solution \(u=\sin 2\pi x\) at \(x=\frac{1}{4}\), \(x=\frac{1}{2}\), and \(x=\frac{3}{4}\).
**6.**: What 5 by 5 system replaces (6) if the boundary conditions are changed to \(u(0)=1\), \(u(1)=0\)?
**Problems 7-11 are about roundoff error and row exchanges.**
**7.**: Compute \(H^{-1}\) in two ways for the 3 by 3 Hilbert matrix

\[H=\begin{bmatrix}1&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{1}{3}\\ \frac{1}{2}&\frac{1}{3}&\frac{1}{4}\\ \frac{1}{3}&\frac{1}{4}&\frac{1}{5}\end{bmatrix},\]

first by exact computation and second by rounding off each number to three figures. This matrix \(H\) is ill-conditioned and row exchanges don't help.
**8.**: For the same matrix \(H\), compare the right-hand sides of \(Hx=b\) when the solutions are \(x=(1,1,1)\) and \(x=(0,6,-3.6)\).
**9.**: Solve \(Hx=b=(1,0,\ldots,0)\) for the 10 by 10 Hilbert matrix with \(h_{ij}=1/(i+j-1)\), using any computer code for linear equations. Then change an entry of \(b\) by .0001 and compare the solutions.
**10.**: Compare the pivots in direct elimination to those with partial pivoting for

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}.001&0\\ 1&1000\end{bmatrix}.\]

(This is actually an example that needs rescaling before elimination.)
**11.**: Explain why partial pivoting produces multipliers \(\ell_{ij}\) in \(L\) that satisfy \(|\ell_{ij}|\leq 1\). Can you construct a 3 by 3 example with all \(|a_{ij}|\leq 1\) whose last pivot is 4? This is the worst possible, since each entry is at most doubled when \(|\ell_{ij}|\leq 1\).
