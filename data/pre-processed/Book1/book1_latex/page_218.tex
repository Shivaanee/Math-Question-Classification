1. (a) Write the four equations for fitting \(y=C+Dt\) to the data \[\begin{array}{llll}y=-4&\text{at}&t=-2,&y=-3&\text{at}&t=-1\\ y=-1&\text{at}&t=1,&y=0&\text{at}&t=2.\end{array}\] Show that the columns are orthogonal. (b) Find the optimal straight line, draw its graph, and write \(E^{2}\). (c) Interpret the zero error in terms of the original system of four equations in two unknowns: The right-hand side \((-4,-3,-1,0)\) is in the space.
2. Project \(b=(0,3,0)\) onto each of the orthonormal vectors \(a_{1}=(\frac{2}{3},\frac{2}{3},-\frac{1}{3})\) and \(a_{2}=(-\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{2}{3})\), and then find its projection \(p\) onto the plane of \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\).
3. Find also the projection of \(b=(0,3,0)\) onto \(a_{3}=(\frac{2}{3},-\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})\), and add the three projections. Why is \(P=a_{1}a_{1}^{\mathrm{T}}+a_{2}a_{2}^{\mathrm{T}}+a_{3}a_{3}^{\mathrm{T}}\) equal to \(I\)?
4. If \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are orthogonal matrices, so that \(Q^{\mathrm{T}}Q=I\), show that \(Q_{1}Q_{2}\) is also orthogonal. If \(Q_{1}\) is rotation through \(\theta\), and \(Q_{2}\) is rotation through \(\phi\), what is
