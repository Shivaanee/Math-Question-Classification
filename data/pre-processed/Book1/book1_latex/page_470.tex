### The Sum of Two Vector Spaces

Usually, after discussing the intersection of two sets, it is natural to look at their Union. With vector spaces, this is not natural. _The union \(\mathbf{V}\cup\mathbf{W}\) of two subspaces will not in general be a subspace_. If \(\mathbf{V}\) and \(\mathbf{W}\) are the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis in the plane, the two axes together are not a subspace. The sum of \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\) is not on either axis.

We do want to combine \(\mathbf{V}\) and \(\mathbf{W}\). In place of their union we turn to their sum.

**Definition.** If \(\mathbf{V}\) and \(\mathbf{W}\) are both subspaces of a given space, so is their _sum_. \(\mathbf{V}+\mathbf{W}\) contains all combinations \(v+w\), where \(v\) is in \(\mathbf{V}\) and \(w\) is in \(\mathbf{W}\).

\(\mathbf{V}+\mathbf{W}\) is the smallest vector space that contains both \(\mathbf{V}\) and \(\mathbf{W}\). The sum of the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis is the whole \(x\)-\(y\) plane. So is the sum of any two different lines, _perp
