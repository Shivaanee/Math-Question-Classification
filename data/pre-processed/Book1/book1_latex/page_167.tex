**1.23**: How can you construct a matrix that transforms the coordinate vectors \(e_{1},e_{2},e_{3}\) into three given vectors \(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\)? When will that matrix be invertible?

**1.24**: If \(e_{1},e_{2},e_{3}\) are in the column space of a 3 by 5 matrix, does it have a left-inverse?

Does it have a right-inverse?

Suppose \(T\) is the linear transformation on \(\mathbf{R}^{3}\) that takes each point \((u,v,w)\) to \((u+v+w,u+v,u)\), Describe what \(T^{-1}\) does to the point \((x,y,z)\).

**1.26**: _True or false?_

1. Every subspace of \(\mathbf{R}^{4}\) is the nullspace of some matrix.
2. If \(A\) has the same nullspace as \(A^{\mathrm{T}}\), the matrix must be square.
3. The transformation that takes \(x\) to \(mx+b\) is linear (from \(\mathbf{R}^{1}\) to \(\mathbf{R}^{1}\)).

**1.27**: Find bases for the four fundamental subspaces of

\[A_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2&0&3\\ 0&2&2&2\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&4\end{bmatrix}\qquad\text{and}\qquad A_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 1\\ 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&4\end{bmatrix}.\]

**1.28**: (a) If the rows of \(A\) are linearly independent (\(A\) is \(m\) by \(n\)) then the rank is , the column space is , and the left nullspace is .

(b) If \(A\) is 8 by 10 with a two-dimensional nullspace, show that \(Ax=b\) can be solved for every \(b\).

**1.29**: Describe the linear transformations of the \(x\)-\(y\) plane that are represented with standard basis \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\) by the matrices
