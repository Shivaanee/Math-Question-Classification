1. Factor \(A\) into \(LU\), assuming \(v_{2}\neq 0\). 2. Find \(A^{-1}\), which has the same form as \(A\).

**1.19**: Solve by elimination, or show that there is no solution:

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}u&+&v&+&w&=&0\\ u&+&2v&+&3w&=&0\\ 3u&+&5v&+&7w&=&1\end{array}\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad\begin{array}{ccccccccc}u&+&v&+&w&=&0\\ u&+&u&+&3w&=&0\\ 3u&+&5v&+&7w&=&1.\end{array}\]
**1.20**: The \(n\) by \(n\) permutation matrices are an important example of a "group." If you multiply them you stay inside the group; they have inverses in the group; the identity is in the group; and the law \(P_{1}(P_{2}P_{3})=(P_{1}P_{2})P_{3}\) is true--because it is true for all matrices.

1. How many members belong to the groups of \(4\) by \(4\) and \(n\) by \(n\) permutation matrices? 2. Find a power \(k\) so that all \(3\) by \(3\) permutation matrices satisfy \(P^{k}=I\).
**1.21**: Describe the rows of \(DA\) and the columns of \(AD\) if \(D=[\begin{smallmatrix}2&0\\ 0&5\end{smallmatrix}]\).
**1.22**: 1. If \(A\) is invertible what is the inverse of \(A^{\rm T}\)? 2. If \(A\) is also symmetric what is the transpose of \(A^{-1}\)? 3. Illustrate both formulas when \(A=[\begin{smallmatrix}2&1\\ 1&1\end{smallmatrix}]\).
**1.23**: By experiment with \(n=2\) and \(n=3\), find

\[\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&0\end{bmatrix}^{n},\qquad\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}^{n},\qquad\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}^{-1}.\]
**1.24**: Starting with a first plane \(u+2v-w=6\), find the equation for

1. the parallel plane through the origin. 2. a second plane that also contains the points \((6,0,0)\) and \((2,2,0)\). 3. a third plane that meets the first and second in the point \((4,1,0)\).
**1.25**: What multiple of row \(2\) is subtracted from row \(3\) in forward elimination of A?

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 2&1&0\\ 0&5&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&2&0\\ 0&1&5\\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}.\]

How do you know (without multiplying those factors) that \(A\) is _invertible_, _symmetric_, and _tridiagonal_? What are its pivots?

**1.26**: 1. What vector \(x\) will make \(Ax=\) column \(1\) of \(A+2\)(column \(3\)), for a \(3\) by \(3\) matrix
