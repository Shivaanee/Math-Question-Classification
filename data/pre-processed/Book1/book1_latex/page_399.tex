integrate the left side by parts to reach \(Ay=f\), proving that _Galerkin gives the same \(A\) and \(f\) as Rayleigh-Ritz for symmetric problems_.
**6.**: A basic identity for quadratics shows \(y=A^{-1}b\) as minimizing:

\[P(y)=\frac{1}{2}y^{\mathrm{T}}Ay-y^{\mathrm{T}}b=\frac{1}{2}(y-A^{-1}b)^{ \mathrm{T}}A(y-A^{-1}b)-\frac{1}{2}b^{\mathrm{T}}A^{-1}b.\]

The minimum over a _subspace_ of trial functions is at the \(y\) nearest to \(A^{-1}b\). (That makes the first term on the right as small as possible; it is the key to convergence of \(U\) to \(u\).) If \(A=I\) and \(b=(1,0,0)\), which multiple of \(V=(1,1,1)\) gives the smallest value of \(P(y)=\frac{1}{2}y^{\mathrm{T}}y-y_{1}\)?
**7.**: For a single hat function \(V(x)\) centered at \(x=\frac{1}{2}\), compute \(A=\int(V^{\prime})^{2}dx\) and \(M=\int V^{2}dx\). In the 1 by 1 eigenvalue problem, is \(\lambda=A/M\) larger or smaller than the true eigenvalue \(\lambda=\pi^{2}\)?
**8.**: For the hat functions \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) centered at \(x=h=\frac{1}{3}\) and \(x=2h=\frac{2}{3}\), compute the 2 by 2 mass matrix \(M_{ij}=\int V_{i}V_{j}dx\), and solve the eigenvalue problem \(Ax=\lambda Mx\).
**9.**: What is the mass matrix \(M_{ij}=\int V_{i}V_{j}dx\) for \(n\) hat functions with \(h=\frac{1}{n+1}\)?
