10. 1. Why does it take approximately \(n^{2}/2\) multiplication-subtraction steps to solve each of \(Lc=b\) and \(Ux=c\)? 2. How many steps does elimination use in solving 10 systems with the same 60 by 60 coefficient matrix \(A\)?
11. Solve as two triangular systems, without multiplying \(LU\) to find \(A\): \[LUx=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 1&1&0\\ 1&0&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2&4&4\\ 0&1&2\\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}u\\ v\\ w\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2\\ 0\\ 2\end{bmatrix}.\]
12. How could you factor \(A\) into a product \(UL\), upper triangular times lower triangular? Would they be the same factors as in \(A=LU\)?
13. Solve by elimination, exchanging rows when necessary: \[\begin{array}{
