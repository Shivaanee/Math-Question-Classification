* For which numbers \(c\) and \(d\) does \(A\) have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors? \[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&2&0\\ 2&d&c\\ 0&5&3\end{bmatrix}.\] (2.2) For which \(c\) and \(d\) can we find three orthonormal vectors that are combinations of the columns (don't do it!)?
* If the vectors \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are in the columns of \(S\), what are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \[A=S\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}S^{-1}\qquad\text{and}\qquad B=S\begin{bmatrix}2&3\\ 0&1\end{bmatrix}S^{-1}?\]

* What is the limit as \(k\to\infty\) (the Markov steady state) of \(\begin{bmatrix}.4&.3\\ .6&.7\end{bmatrix}^{k}\begin{bmatrix}a\\ b\end{bmatrix}?\)
