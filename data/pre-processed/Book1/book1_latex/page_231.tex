**20.**: Find the eigenvalues of the "periodic" \(-1\), \(2\), \(-1\) matrix \(C\). The \(-1\)s in the corners of \(C\) make it periodic (**a circulant matrix**):

\[C=\begin{bmatrix}2&-1&0&-1\\ -1&2&-1&0\\ 0&-1&2&-1\\ -1&0&-1&2\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{has}\quad c_{0}=2,\;c_{1}=-1,\;c_{2}=0,\;c_{3 }=-1.\]
**21.**: To multiply \(C\) times \(x\), when \(C=FEF^{-1}\), we can multiply \(F(E(F^{-1}x))\) instead. The direct \(Cx\) uses \(n^{2}\) separate multiplications. Knowing \(E\) and \(F\), the second way uses only \(n\log_{2}n+n\) multiplications. How many of those come from \(E\), how many from \(F\), and how many from \(F^{-1}\)?
**22.**: How could you quickly compute these four components of \(Fc\) starting from \(c_{0}+c_{2}\), \(c_{0}-c_{2}\), \(c_{1}+c_{3}\), \(c_{1}-c_{3}\)? You are finding the Fast Fourier Transform!

\[Fc=\begin{bmatrix}c_{0}+c_{1}+c_{2}+c_{3}\\ c_{0}+ic_{1}+i^{2}c_{2}+i^{3}c_{3}\\ c_{0}+i^{2}c_{1}+i^{4}c_{2}+i^{6}c_{3}\\ c_{0}+i^{3}c_{1}+i^{6}c_{2}+i^{9}c_{3}\end{bmatrix}.\]
