**20.**: If \(P\) is the projection onto the column space of \(A\), what is the projection onto the left nullspace?
**21.**: Suppose \(L_{1}\) is the line through the origin in the direction of \(a_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\) is the line through \(b\) in the direction of \(a_{2}\). To find the closest points \(x_{1}a_{1}\) and \(b+x_{2}a_{2}\) on the two lines, write the two equations for the \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) that minimize \(\|x_{1}a_{1}-x_{2}a_{2}-b\|\). Solve for \(x\) if \(a_{1}=(1,1,0)\), \(a_
