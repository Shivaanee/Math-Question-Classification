**8.**: Find \(x^{*}\), \(y^{*}\) and the value \(v\) for

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\ 0&2&0\\ 0&0&3\end{bmatrix}.\]
**9.**: Compute

\[\min_{\begin{subarray}{c}y_{i}\geq 0\\ y_{1}+y_{2}=1\end{subarray}}\max_{\begin{subarray}{c}x_{1}\geq 0\\ x_{1}+x_{2}=1\end{subarray}}(x_{1}y_{1}+x_{2}y_{2}).\]
**10.**: Explain each of the inequalities in equation (5). Then, once the minimax theorem has turned them into equalities, derive (again in words) the saddle point equations (4).
**11.**: Show that \(x^{*}=(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},0,0)\) and \(y^{*}=(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})\) are optimal strategies in our simplified version of poker, by computing \(yAx^{*}\) and \(y^{*}Ax\) and verifying the conditions (4) for a saddle point.
**12.**: Has it been proved that no chess strategy always wins for black? This is certainly true when the players are given two moves at a time; if black had a winning strategy, white could move a knight out and back and then follow that strategy, leading to the impossible conclusion that both would win.
**13.**: If \(X\) chooses a prime number and simultaneously \(Y\) guesses whether it is odd or even (with gain or loss of $1), who has the advantage?
**14.**: If \(X\) is a quarterback, with the choice of run or pass, and \(Y\) can defend against a run or a pass, suppose the payoff (in yards) is

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}2&8\\ 6&-6\end{bmatrix}\text{ defense against run}\]

\[\text{run}\quad\text{pass}\]

What are the optimal strategies and the average gain on each play?
