**4.** By applying row operations to produce an upper triangular \(U\), compute

\[\det\left[\begin{matrix}1&2&-2&0\\ 2&3&-4&1\\ -1&-2&0&2\\ 0&2&5&3\end{matrix}\right]\qquad\text{and}\qquad\det\left[\begin{matrix}2&-1&0&0 \\ -1&2&-1&0\\ 0&-1&2&-1\\ 0&0&-1&-2\end{matrix}\right].\]

Exchange rows 3 and 4 of the second matrix and recompute the pivots and determinant.

_Note_. Some readers will already know a formula for 3 by 3 determinants. It has six terms (equation (2) of the next section), three going parallel to the main diagonal and three others going the opposite way with minus signs. There is a similar formula for 4 by 4 determinants, _but it contains \(4!=24\) terms_ (_not just eight_). You cannot even be sure that a minus sign goes with the reverse diagonal, as the next exercises show.

**5.** Count row exchanges to find these determinants:

\[\det\left[\begin{matrix}0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&1&0&0\\ 1&0&0&0\end{matrix}\right]=\pm 1\qquad\text{and}\qquad\det\left[\begin{matrix}0&1&0&0 \\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&0&0&1\\ 1&0&0&0\end{matrix}\right]=-1.\]

**6.** For each \(n\), how many exchanges will put (row \(n\), row \(n-1,\dots\), row 1) into the normal order (row 1, ..., row \(n-1\), row \(n\))? Find \(\det P\) for the \(n\) by \(n\) permutation with 1s on the reverse diagonal. Problem 5 had \(n=4\).

**7.** Find the determinants of:

1. a rank one matrix \[A=\begin{bmatrix}1\\ 4\\ 2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2&-1&2\end{bmatrix}.\]
2. the upper triangular matrix \[U=\begin{bmatrix}4&4&8&8\\ 0&1&2&2\\ 0&0&2&6\\ 0&0&0&2\end{bmatrix}.\]
3. the lower triangular matrix \(U^{\mathrm{T}}\).
4. the inverse matrix \(U^{-1}\).
