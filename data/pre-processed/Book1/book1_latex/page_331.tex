### Problem Set 5.5

**1.**: For the complex numbers \(3+4i\) and \(1-i\),

1. find their positions in the complex plane.
2. find their sum and product.
3. find their conjugates and their absolute values.

Do the original numbers lie inside or outside the unit circle?
**2.**: What can you say about

1. the sum of a complex number and its conjugate?
2. the conjugate of a number on the unit circle?
3. the product of two numbers on the unit circle?
4. the sum of two numbers on the unit circle?
**3.**: If \(x=2+i\) and \(y=1+3i\), find \(\overline{x}\), \(x\overline{x}\), \(1/x\), and \(x/y\). Check that the absolute value \(|xy|\) equals \(|x|\) times \(|y|\), and the absolute value \(|1/x|\) equals 1 divided by \(|x|\).
**4.**: Find \(a\
