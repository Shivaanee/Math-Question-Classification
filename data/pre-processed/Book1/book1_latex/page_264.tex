_Hint:_ Subtracting the last row from each of the others leaves \[\det\begin{bmatrix}2&2&1\\ -1&3&1\\ 1&-4&1\end{bmatrix}=\det\begin{bmatrix}1&6&0\\ -2&7&0\\ 1&-4&1\end{bmatrix}=\det\begin{bmatrix}1&6\\ -2&7\end{bmatrix}.\] Sketch \(A^{\prime}=(1,6)\), \(B^{\prime}=(-2,7)\), \(C^{\prime}=(0,0)\) and their relation to \(A\), \(B\), \(C\).
**6.** Explain in terms of volumes why \(\det 3A=3^{n}\det A\) for an \(n\) by \(n\) matrix \(A\).
**7.** Predict in advance, and confirm by elimination, the pivot entries of

\[A=\begin{bmatrix}2&1&2\\ 4&5&0\\ 2&7&0\end{bmatrix}\qquad\text{ and }\qquad B=\begin{bmatrix}2&1&2\\ 4&5&3\\ 2&7&0\end{bmatrix}.\]
**8.** Find all the odd permutations of the numbers \(\{1,2,3,4\}\). They come from an odd number of exchanges and lead to \(\det P=-1\).
**9.** Suppose the permutation \(P\) takes \((1,2,3,4,5)\) to \((5,4,1,2,3)\).

1. What does \(P^{2}\) do to \((1,2,3,4,5)\)?
2. What does \(P^{-1}\) do to \((1,2,3,4,5)\)?
**10.** If \(P\) is an odd permutation, explain why \(P^{2}\) is even but \(P^{-1}\) is odd.
**11.** Prove that if you keep multiplying \(A\) by the same permutation matrix \(P\), the first row eventually comes back to its original place.
**12.** If \(A\) is a 5 by 5 matrix with all \(|a_{ij}|\leq 1\), then \(\det A\leq\underline{\ \
